* Signal Transduction
- Cell to cell communication signals

- Extracellular signal molecules :: molecules that travel between two cells to signal to another

- Most cells both emit and receive signals

- Receptor protein :: protein that will bind to a specific signal molecule, activating an intracellular signaling pathway/system
     - For transmembrane proteins, a ligand (extracellular signal molecule) binds to receptor to trigger an intracellular response
- Effector protein :: protein at the end of the signaling pathway that will cause a change in the cell

- Apoptosis :: programmed cell death
- Terminal differentiation :: differentiation into a nondividing state

** Short Distance
*** Contact-Dependent Signaling
- Most extracellular signal molecules stay bound to the surface of the signaling cell and influence cells it comes in contact with

*** Paracrine
- Secreted molecules can be local mediators taht act on cells in the local environment
- Signaling and target cells are often different types in this case
- Cells signalling themselves is called autocrine signaling

** Long Distance
*** Synaptic Signaling
- Signal travels down a chain of neurons
- Goes from one pre-synapse to post-synapse via neurotransmitter
- Neuron sends an electrical impulse down it to trigger neurotransmitter release

*** Endocrine
- Hormone :: Secreted signal molecule that travels down the bloodstream
- The blood carries the hormones to target cells practically anywhere in the body

** Major Classes of Cell-Surface Receptor Proteins
*** Ion-Channel-Coupled Receptors
- Also known as transmitter-gated ion channels or ionotropic receptors
- Involved in rapid synaptic signaling between nerve cells and other excitable target cells
- Mediated by small number of neurotransmitters that transiently open/close an ion channel

*** G-Protein-Coupled Receptors
- Indirectly regulates activity of a separate plasma-membrane-bound target protein (enzyme or ion channel)
- Trimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein) mediates interaction between activated receptor and target protein
- Activation of target protein can change the concentration of one or more small intracellular signaling molecules or change ion permeability of the plasma membrane

*** Enzyme-Coupled Receptors
- Either function as enzymes or associate directly with enzymes that they activate
- Usually single-pass transmembrane proteins that have ligand-binding sites outside the cell and their catalytic or enzyme-binding site inside
- Heterogenous in structure compared with other receptors

** Intracellular Signal Relaying
- Second messenger :: intracellular signaling molecules that are generated in response to receptor activation
- Passes the signal on by binding/altering behaviour of selected signaling or effector proteins
- Largest class of molecular switches are proteins that are activated/inactivated through phosphorylation
  - Switch thrown one direction by protein kinase which adds phosphate groups to amino acids on the signaling protein
  - Switch thrown other direction by protein phosphatase which removes phosphate groups
- Many signaling proteins are protein kinases, causing a kinase cascade of phosphorylation

*** Protein Kinases
- Serine/threonine kinases :: phosphorylates hydroxyl groups of serines and threonines in their targets
- Tyrosine kinases :: phosphorylates proteins on tyrosines

*** GTP-binding proteins
- Switch between on (actively signaling) state where GTP is bound and off where GDP is bound

**** Types of GTP-binding proteins
- Trimeric GTP-binding proteins :: relay signals from G-protein coupled receptors that activate them
- Monomeric GTPases :: help relay signals from many classes of cell-surface receptors

**** Regulatory proteins
- GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) :: drive proteins into an off state by increasing hydrolysis rate of bound GTP
- Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) :: activates GTP-binding proteins by promoting release of bound GDP

*** Intracellular Signaling Complexes
- Specificity for signaling molecules can be achieved by isolating molecules within the same parts of a cell/complex
- Scaffold protein :: brings together groups of interacting signaling proteins into signaling complexes often before a signal has been received
- Allows for high local concentration and rapid sequential activations

**** Modular Interaction Domains
- Mediates interactions between intracellular signaling proteins
- Allows induced proximity to activate signaling proteins
- Assemblies of signaling complexes rely on small interaction domains that bind to particular structure motifs on proteins and lipids
- Some signaling proteins are solely 2 or more interaction domains to function as adapters to link two other proteins together

***** Src Homology 2 (SH2) and Phosphotyrosine-Binding (PTB) Domains
- Bind to phosphorylated tyrosines in a particular peptide sequence on activated receptors or intracellular signaling proteins

***** Src Homology 3 (SH3) Domains
- Bind to short, proline-rich amino acid sequences

***** Pleckstrin Homology (PH) Domains
- Binds to charged head groups of specific phosphoinositides produced in the plasma membrane in response to intracellular signal

*** Signaling Pathway Variations
**** Response Timing
- Varies drastically in different signaling systems according to the speed required for a response

***** Examples
- Synaptic signaling can have a response fire in milliseconds
- Morphogens affecting cell fate during development can take hours or days

**** Sensitivity
- Different pathways will have different sensitivities to different extracellular signals
- Controlled by number of receptors/ affinity to the signal molecules

***** Examples
- Hormones tend to act at low concentrations on their distant target cells
- Neurotransmitters operate at might higher concentrations at the synapse

**** Dynamic Range
- Related to sensitivity
- Range of signal concentrations that a pathway will react to
- Achieved by adaptation mechanisms that adjust the responsiveness the system according to prevailing amount of signal

***** Examples
- Developmental decisions are responsive over a narrow range
- Metabolic response to hormones are responsive over a broad range

**** Response Persistence
- Some responses will last briefly, while others will be prolonged

***** Examples
- Less than a second appropriate for synaptic responses
- Prolonged/permanent responses required in cell fate decisions

**** Signal Processing
- Converts simple signal into a complex response

***** Examples
- Gradual increase in extracellular signal converted into abrupt, switchlike response
- Simple input signal converted into oscillatory response, produced by repeating signal of transient intracellular signals

**** Integration
- Allows a response to be governed by multiple inputs
- Specific combinations of signals may be necessary to stimulate complex cell behaviours
- Often relies on coincidence detectors, which only activate when receiving multiple converging signals

**** Coordination
- Can be achieved by a signal extracellular signal
- Depends on mechanisms for distributing the signal to multiple effectors

***** Examples
- Some can stimulate a cell to be grow and divide
