# Exam 1
* Intro to Physiology
- Physiology: the study of the functions of organisms
- Organ system: collection of anatomical structures that work together to carry out a specific function

** Body Organisation 
*** Cell
- Smallest independent unit that makes up a living organism that are specialised in different functions

**** Major Types of Cells
- Neurons - Specialised to transmit information in the form of electrical signals
- Muscle Cells - Specialised to contract, generating mechanical force and movement
- Epithelial Cells - Continuous, sheetlike layer of cells in combination with a thin underlying layer of noncellular material (basement membrane)
- Connective Tissue Cells - Any structure whose primary function is to provide physical support for other structures

*** Tissue
- Collection of similarly functional cells

**** Major Groups of Tissue
- Nervous tissue
- Muscle tissue
- Epithelial tissue
- Connective tissue

*** Organ
- When two or more tissues combine to make a structure that performs a particular function

*** Organ System
- Collection of organs that work together to perform certain functions

** The Body Plan
*** External Environment
- Layer of epithelial tissue separates the external environment from the body interior
- Layer consists of skin, lung lining, GI lining, and kidney tubules

*** Internal Environment
- Most of body is not able to directly interface with external environment
- Blood is contained within epithelium-lined blood vessels

*** Body Fluid Compartments
- Most abundant substance in body is water
- Total Body Water (TBW) - total volume of fluid enclosed within outer epithelial layer
  - Intracellular Fluid (ICF) - Fluid inside the cells
  - Extracellular Fluid (ECF) - Fluid outside the cells
    - Plasma - liquid in the blood
    - Interstitial fluid - liquid outside the blood that bathes most of the cells in the body

** Homeostasis
- Maintenance of relatively constant conditions in the internal environment of the body
- Example of Homeostasis: glucose maintenance

*** Negative Feedback Control
- Regulated variable - value that must stay within certain limits
- Setpoint - normal desired value for the feedback loop
- If the regulated variable increases, then the feedback works to decrease it and vice versa

*** Positive Feedback Control
- The system responds in the same direction as the change

* Homeostasis
- Body's internal composition is constantly challenged by external factors and internal metabolic activities
- Homeostasis :: the maintenance of extracellular fluids (ECF) to be relatively constant
		 - Depends on mass balance
- Homeostasis and an essential feature of complex organisms and a central theme in physiology
- All organs act on the ECF to maintain homeostasis

- Equilibrium :: equal amount of substance between intracellular plasma  and interstitual fluid
		 - Gases, water, lipid-soluble substance (steroids, fatty acids) can transport through capillaries
- Steady State :: constant amount of substance in ECF and ICF compartments (input == output)
		 - Requires energy to maintain

** Factors Under Homeostatic Control
- Nutrients
- Gases
- Waste products
- pH
- Salt and other electrolytes
- Temperature
- Volume and pressure

** Control Center
- Relex :: Response made at a distance from target cell
- Local Response :: Response made at target cell
		    - Occurs only in the area of the stimulus, neither nerves nor hormones involved

** Efferent Division


** Reflex Arc
- Involves both nervous and endocrine system

*** Stretch Reflex Arc
- 1a sensory afferent neuron :: senses stretch and sends info to spinal cord
- alpha motor neuron :: sends information towards muscle
- Skeletal muscle fiber :: neuromuscular junction

- Stretch induces depolarisation, as does opening of mechanosensitive channels
- They combine to make a stronger signal

*** General Components in Order of Pathway
1. Integrating Center
2. Efferent Pathway
3. Effector
4. Response
5. Feedback
6. Stimulus
7. Receptor
8. Afferent Pathway
9. Loops back to integrating center

** +/- Feedback
- The goal of feedback loops are to maintain a setpoint
- Hierarchy of importance since not everything can be maintained at setpoint

- Negative Feedback :: Response counteracts the stimulus, shutting off the response loop
- Positive Feedback :: Response reinforces the stimulus, sending the parameter farther from the setpoint

** Glucose Regulation
- Negative feedback
- Setpoint: About 80 mg/100 mL
- Only liver stores and releases glucose into the blood

*** Glucose High
1. Stimulus: Rising glucose level (such as from eating carb-rich meal)
2. Integrating Center: Beta cells in pancreas release insulin into blood
3. Effector: Liver takes up glucose to store as glycogen, body cells take up more glucose
4. Response: Blood glucose declines back to setpoint, decreasing insulin release

*** Glucose Low
1. Stimulus: Dropping glucose level (such as from skipping a meal)
2. Integrating Center: Alpha cells in pancreas release glucagon into blood
3. Effector: Liver breaks down glycogen and releases glucose into blood
4. Response: Blood glucose rises up to setpoint, decreasing glucagon release
* Endocrine System
** Transport
*** Simple Diffusion
 - Does not require specific protein
 - Solute transported with gradient (high concentration to low concentration)
 - No ATP needed

 - Occurs as a result of random thermal motion of molecules (random walk)
 - Over time, molecules will spread to near evenly fill a compartment

 - Flux :: the amount of material crossing a surface in a unit of time
	   - Net flux account for both directions combined
	   Net flux depends on:
	   - temperature
	   - molecular mass
	   - surface area
	   - medium (water vs air)


**** Distance versus Time
 \begin{equation}
 x=\sqrt{2Dt}
 \end{equation}

 where x is distance diffused (cm), D is diffusion constant, t is time (s)

 \begin{equation}
 D=\frac{KT}{6 \pi r \eta}
 \end{equation}

 where K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature (K), r is molecular radius, n is medium viscosity

 - Note that water is denser than air, so it is easier to diffuse in air (based on D constant)

**** Rate of Diffusion
 - Fick's Law of Diffusion

 \begin{equation}
 J=PA(C_A-C_B)
 \end{equation}

 where J is net flux (mmol/s), P is permeability (cm/s), A is surface area (cm^3), C_A is solution A concentration (mmol/L), C_B is solution C concentration (mmol/L)

**** Permeability
 \begin{equation}
 P=\frac{KD}{\Delta x}
 \end{equation}

 where P is permeability, K is partition coefficient, D is diffusion coefficient, delta x is membrane thickness

 - A higher partition coefficient means a substance will more readily dissolve in a lipid bilayer

***** Diffusion Potential
 - Potential difference generated across a membrane when a charged solute (ion) diffuses down its concentration gradient
 - Created by the movement of only a few ions, and does not cause concentraiton change in bulk solution

**** Osmosis
 - Movement of water through a membrane
 - Not diffusion because it is driven by osmotic pressure difference, not concentration difference

***** Characteristics
 - Always passive
 - Unaffected by membrane potential
 - Driven by osmotic pressure
 - Response to solute concentratio gradient
   - Movement through aquaporins, protein channels

***** Osmolarity
 - Concentration of osmotically active particles in solution

 \begin{equation}
 Osm=gC
 \end{equation}

 where Osm is osmolarity, g is number of particles/mol in solution, C is concentration (mmol/L)

 - Isosmotic :: Two solutions with same calculated osmolarity
 - Hyperosmotic :: Solution with higher osmolarity
 - Hyposmotic :: Solution with lower osmolarity

***** Osmotic Pressure
 - Van't Hoff Equation

 \begin{equation}
 \pi=gCRT
 \end{equation}

 where pi is osmotic pressure (atm), g is number of particles/mol in solution, C is concentration (mmol/L), R is gas constant, T is absolute temp (K)

 - Water moves from low osmotic pressure to high osmotic pressure

 - Van't Hoff Equation can be modified to include the extent to which a particular solute crosses a particular membrane (effective osmotic pressure)

 \begin{equation}
 \pi=gC \sigma RT
 \end{equation}

 where sigma is reflection coefficient (from 0 to 1)

***** Tonicity
 - Function of the concentration of nonpermeating solutes outside a cell relative to concentration inside a cell

 - Isotonic :: 300 mOsm
 - Hypotonic :: Lesser than 300 mOsm, cell swells
 - Hypertonic :: Greater than 300 mOsm, cell shrinks

*** Facilitated Transport
 - Requires specific protein
 - Solute transported with gradient
 - Does not require ATP

*** Active Transport (Primary)
 - Requires specific protein
 - Solute transported against gradient (low concentration to high concentration)
 - Requires ATP

*** Cotransport (Secondary)
 - Requires specific protein
 - Solute transported against gradient
 - Does not require ATP
 - Driven by movement of cotransported ion down its gradient

*** Countertransport (Secondary)
 - Ion and second solute move in opposite directions

*** Carrier-Mediated Transport
**** Features
 - Saturation :: Carrier proteins have a limited number of binding sites for the solute
 - Sterospecificity :: Binding site for solute on the transport proteins are stereospecific
 - Competition :: Transporter can bind chemically-related solutes

**** Kinetics
 \begin{equation}
 v_0=\frac{v_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]}
 \end{equation}

 where v_0 is velocity, v_max is maximum velocity, K_m is constant

**** Transporters
 - Carrier proteins open and allow solute to pass the bilayer when the solute is bound to the protein (example: glucose)

*** Ions
**** Electrolytes
 - Chemical and electrical gradients influence ion movement
 - Chemical driving force goes from high to low gradient
 - Electrical driving force goes to the side of the membrane of opposite charge

**** Determining Driving Force Direction
 - If V_m < E_x, electrochemical driving force is going out of cell
 - If V_m > E_x, electrochemical driving force is going into cell

**** Equilibrium Potential
 - Membrane voltage for a particular ion at equilibirum (when the electrochemical gradient is 0 and there is not net flow)
 - Excess anions on the intracellular side, excess cations on the extracellular side

***** Nernst Equation
 \begin{equation}
 V=\frac{RT}{zF}ln\frac{C_o}{C_i}
 \end{equation}

 where V is equilibrium potential (V as internal - external), C are outer and inner ion concentration, R is gas constant, T is absolute temperature (K), F is Faraday's constant, z is ion valence (charge)

 Alternatively, ln can be replaced with 2.303log_10:

 \begin{equation}
 V=2.303\frac{RT}{zF}log\frac{C_o}{C_i}
 \end{equation}

 In most cases, z = 1, and $2.303\frac{RT}{F}$ is 61:

 \begin{equation}
 V=\frac{61}{1}log\frac{C_o}{C_i}
 \end{equation}

**** Diffusion
 - Ion diffusion through the membrane is done through protein channels

***** Leaky Ion Channels
 - Randomly opens and allows ions to move along the concentration gradient (high to low)

***** Gated Ion Channels
 - Voltage-Gated :: Opens due to voltage change
 - Ligand-Gated :: Opens when a substance is bound to binding sites on the channel
 - Mechanically-Gated :: Opens when a conformation change in the membrane, etc occurs, forcing it open

*** Pumps
**** Sodium Potassium Pump
 - Sodium-Potassium pump moves 3 Na+ out of the cell and 2 K+ into the cell every time it hydrolyses ATP
 - Electrogenic :: Drives a net current across the membrane, creating an electrical potential that is often no more than 10% to the membrane potential
 - Direct role in controlling solute concentration, regulating cytosol osmolarity

*** Membrane-Bound Compartment Transport
 - Transport of macromolecules

**** Endocytosis
 - Phagocytosis :: Cell membrane engulfs particle, breaks off into phagosome, matures into lysosome, and breaks down particle
 - Pinocytosis :: Cell membrane engulfs dissolved molecules, breaks off into endosome, and transports molecules to final destination
 - Receptor-Mediated :: Receptor protein is bound by molecule, causing coated pit to change conformation and form vesicle

**** Exocytosis
 - Secretory vesicle fuses to plasma membrane, releasing contents

** Chemical Messengers
 Mechanisms of Cell Signaling:
 - Direct contact between cells -through gap junctions
 - Indirect communication through chemical messengers - messenger is released from secretory cell and received by receptor in target cell
   - Local:
     - Paracrine signaling - short distance, transports through diffusion
       - Autocrine signaling - cell signals to itself
     - Synaptic signaling - short distance, transports through diffusion
   - Long Distnace:
     - Endocrine signaling - long distance, transports through blood

*** Target Response Strength
 Depends on
 - Messenger cocnentration
 - Number of receptors per target cell
 - Receptor affinity for the messenger

**** Up-regulation
 - Receptor number increases on target cell
 - May result from too little messengers
 - Sensitivity to messenger increases

**** Down-regulation
 - Receptor number decreases on target cell
 - May result from excess messengers
 - Tolerance to messenger develops

*** Transport
**** Bloodborne
 - Source and target located at a distance
 - Lipophobic ligands dissolve in plasma
 - Lipophilic ligands bind to carrier protein

**** Diffusion through interstitial fluid
 - Source and target are close
 - Ligand is quickly degraded

**** Receptors
 - Nonpolar signals bind to receptor inside cell
 - Polar signals bind to transmembrane receptors

*** Endocrine System
 - Crucial for cells from one region to communicate to distant cells to maintain homeostasis
 - Body uses endocrine system and nervous system for long distance communication

 - Endocrine target secretes a hormone that enters the blood
 - Blood spans the distance to the target

*** Hormones
**** Hormone Interactions
 - Antagonism :: Effect when hormones oppose each other
 - Additive :: Net effect equals sum of individual effects
 - Synergistic :: Effect of two homrones favour each other but net effect exceeds sum of individual effect
 - Permissiveness :: One hormone is needed to exert another's effect

*** Stimuli for Release
**** Direct Inputs
 - Ions or nutrients
 - Neurotransmitters
 - Hormones

*** Organs that Release Hormones
**** Primary Organs

*** What Kind of Stimuli (Glucose? Ca? Hormones? Neurons?)
**** Lipophobic Ligands (hydrophilic)
 - Synthesis is independent of demand
 - Stored in vesicles of source until needed
 - Released by exocytosis

**** Lipophilic Ligands (hydrophobic)
 - Synthesised on demand
 - Immediate release from source
 - Release rate depends on synthesis

**** Amino Acids (hydrophilic)
 - Targets cell receptors on cell membrane
 - All functino as neurotransmitters
 - Synthesised within neuron and stored in vesicle until needed
 - Released by exocytosis

**** Amines (mostly hydrophilic, except thyroid hormones)
 - Targets receptors on cell membrane
 - Made or derived from an amino acid and contains an amine group, with the product being determined by enzymes present in the cell
 - Produced in the cytosol of the source and stored in vesicle until needed
 - Released by exocytosis

* Nervous System
- Transmit signals within neurons via long axons
  - Signal in axon = action potential
  - Axon action potential spans the distance to target
- Between cells via the synapse

- Overshoot :: Development of charge reversal
- Depolarisation :: Ion movement reduces charge imbalance
- Repolarisation :: Movement back towards resting potential
- Hyperpolarisation :: Development of even more negative charge within cell

** Ion Movements
- Inward current (depolarisation) caused when positive ions go inside cell and negative ions go outside cell
- Outward current (hyperpolarisation) caused when positive ions go outside cell and negative ions go inside cell

- Cl goes the opposite behaviour of Na and K because it is negative

*** Comparing Membrane Potential and Nernst Potential of Ion
- If (Vm - Eion) = 0, driving force is 0 and there is no net flow/current
- If (Vm - Eion) > 0, driving force is positive and there is outward current (hyperpolarisation)
- If (Vm - Eion) < 0, driving force is negative and there is inward current (depolarisation)

** Nervous System Components
*** Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Brain
- Spinal cord

*** Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- Afferent information (input)
- Efferent information (output)

** Cell Structure
*** Neuron

** Types of Proteins that Localise in Different Parts of Neurons


** Produce
*** Resting Potential
- Potential when neuron is not active
- Caused by passive transfer of ions
- Negative

*** Action Potential
- Occurs when cell is depolarised
- Na-K pump is active
- Must reach threshold

*** IPSP

*** Ligand-gated Channels
- Open or close in response to ligand binding
- Dendrites and cell body
- Synaptic potentials

*** Voltage-gated Channels
- Opens or closes in response to change in membrane potential

**** Sodium and Potassium CHannels
- Throughout, but more in the axon (especially in the axon hillock)
- Action potentials
- Typically more Na+ extracellular and more K intracellular
- Na channels open fast and close fast
- K channels open slowly and close slowly

**** Calcium Channels
- Axon terminal
- Release of neurotransmitter

** Threshold Potential
- Potential target for when AP triggers
- Multiple action potentials above threshold will make a stronger signal

*** Refractory Period
- Absolute Refractory Period :: No new action potentials can be triggered
- Relative Refractory Period :: New action potential can be triggered if stimulus is way above threshold

** Calculating Membrane Potential
- Use Nernst equation
- Membrane potential is equal to Nernst membrane potential of an ion if membrane is only permeable to that one ion
- Resting potential is negative because of having many open K+ channels but few open Na+ channels

** Calculating Equilibrium Potential
Use Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

\begin{equation}
E_{rev}=\frac{RT}{F}ln\frac{P_k[K]_o + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_k[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o}
\end{equation}

** Autonomic Nervous System* Homeostasis

# Exam 2
* Sensory Physiology
** Basics
*** Central Nervous System
- Brain
- Spinal cord

**** Spinal Cord Horns
- Dorsal horn :: cell bodies of interneurons on which afferent neurons terminate
- Lateral horn :: cell bodies of autonomic efferent nerve fibers
- Verntral horn :: cell bodies of somatic efferent neurons

*** Peripheral Nervous System
- Cranial nerves
- Ganglia outside the CNS
- Spinal nerves

**** Divisions
***** Afferent (Sensory)
- Sensing external environment
- Sensing internal environment

***** Efferent (Motor)
- Autonomic nervous system
  - Parasympathetic division
  - Sympathetic division
- Somatic nervous system

*** Stretch Receptors
- Stimulation produces a receptor potential/generator potential
- Receptor potential will trigger a graded potential

**** Adaptation
- Tonic receptors :: slowly adapting receptors that respond for the duration of the stimulus (action potentials fire less rapidly)
- Phasic receptors :: rapidly adapts to a constant stimuls and turns off (action potential stops)

** Vision
*** Iris
- Controls amount of light entering eye cavities
- Contraction of radial or smooth muscles permits pupil diameter change
  - Parasympathetic stimulation of circular muscle causes pupillary constriction (bright light)
  - Sympathetic stimulation of radial muscle causes pupillary dilation (dim light)

*** Lense
- Concave surface has focal point in front of lense
- Convex surface has focal point behind lense
- Refraction of light causes mirror image
- Parasympathetic stimulation flattens the lense for distant viewing by relaxing the ciliary muscle to tighten the ciliary zonule
- Sympathetic stimulation bulges the lense for close vision by contracting the ciliary muscle and loosening the ciliary zonule

*** Retina
**** Outer Layer
- Contains retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors

***** Photoreceptors
- Most concentrated by the fovea, and gets less concentrated as you move away
- Rods :: Distinguishes light (black and white)
- Cones :: Distinguishes colour (red - L cone, blue - S cone, green - M cone)

**** Middle Layer
- Contains horizontal cells, bipolar cells, and amacrine cells

**** Inner Layer
- Contains ganglion cells and optic nerve axons

** Hearing

* Muscular System
** Structure
- Attached to bones or to skin (in the case of facial muscles)
- Single, very long, cylindrical multinucleate cells with obvious striations

- Epimysium -> Perimysium -> Fasicle -> Muscle Fiber -> Sarcomere -> Myofibril -> Protein Filament

*** Muscle Organ
- Consists of hundreds to thousands of muscles cells, connective tissue wrappings, blood vessels, and nerve fibers
- Connective tissue covered externally by epimysium

*** Fasicle
- Discrete bundle of muscle cells, segregated from the rest of the muscle by a connective tissue sheath
- Connective tissue surrounded by perimysium

*** Muscle Fiber
- Elongated multinucleate cell with a banded/striated appearance

*** Filament Structure
https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/08/Figure_38_04_04-1024x919.jpg

**** TODO Myosin Structure

**** TODO Actin Structure

**** TODO Thick Filament

**** TODO Thin Filament

** Excitation / Contraction
- Contraction :: Activation of force-generating sites within muscle fibers (cross-bridges)
- Shortening of filament is based on a sliding theory where thin filaments slide along the thick filament
- Voluntary (Sensory input -> integration at brain -> motor output)

*** Excitation
- Controlled by motor neurons
- Neuromuscular junction between neuron acetylcholine vesicle and muscle cell plasma membrane
- Excitation triggered by the release of acetylcholine

**** Acetylcholine
- Released from vesicles in the axon terminal when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are activated
- Binds with nicotinic receptor for activating muscle or is metabolised by acetylcholinesterase
- Binding to receptor causes a Na/K channel to open, allowing Na+ to flow in and K+ to flow out

**** Excitation Steps
1. Ach is released from the axon terminal due to action potential and binds to receptors in the motor end plate, triggering an action potential in the muscle cell
2. Action potential propagates along sarcolemma and down the T tubules
3. Action potential triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum
4. Contraction steps

*** Types of Contraction
- Isometric :: No lengthening or shortening
- Concentric :: When muscle is actively shortening
- Eccentric :: When muscle is actively lengthening

*** Cross-bridge States
**** Relaxation
- Regulatory proteins inhibit actin-myosin interactions
- Few heads are bound to actin
- Sarcomeres can be stretched passively

**** Contraction
- Muscle is activated by calcium
- Thousands of sarcomeres shorten in series causing muscle to shorten
- ATP is hydrolysed and force is produced

**** Rigor (Dead)
- ATP depleted
- Heads are tightly bound to actin
- Strong actin-myosin interaction prevents stretching

*** Stages of Cross-bridge Cycle
https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnsb1003-773/MediaObjects/41594_2003_Article_BFnsb1003773_Fig1_HTML.gif

1. Crossbridge binds to actin when energised by ADP + Pi (Calcium influx)
2. Crossbridge moves and uncocks when ADP + Pi is removed
3. Crossbridge detaches when ATP binds to myosin
4. Crossbridge energises and is cocked  when ATP is hydrolysed to ADP + Pi

- Actin acts to accelerate myosin ATPase

*** Role of Ca2+
- Ca2+ binds to troponin to regulate muscle contraction
- Causes tropomyosin to move, exposing the myosin-binding site on actin

- Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the muscle fiber
- Dantrolene inhibits Ca2+ release
- Small latent period between action potential and muscle fiber shortening occurs

**** Ca2+ Release Steps
1. Muscle action potential propagation down the T-tubule causes ryanodine receptor to open
2. Ca2+ released from lateral sac of sarcoplasmic reticulum
3. Ca2+ binds to troponin, removing the blocking action of tropomyosin
4. Contraction
5. Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
6. Ca2+ removed from troponin, restoring tropomyosin blocking action

** Force
- Force in series: force of one sarcomere
- Force in parallel: sum of the forces of sarcomeres in parallel

- Depends on cross-sectional area of the fiber

*** Factors
**** Crossbridges in parallel 
- Force of each bridge is independent
- Force proportional to number of crossbridges per half-filament
- Forces on left and right side of thick filament don't sum
- https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geoff_Power/publication/233897858/figure/fig2/AS:652207921823745@1532509894408/A-schematic-depicting-the-sarcomere-length-tension-FL-relationship.png

**** Sarcomeres in series
- Force is same in each sarcomere (links in a chain)
- Number of sarcomeres is total length / sarcomere length

**** Fibers in parallel in muscle
- Force generated by each fiber is independent
- Total force = sum(force / fiber) * # of fibers

** Speed
- Velocity of fiber shortening = (velocity of shortening of 1 sarcomere) * (number of sarcomeres in series)
- Longer muscle fibers have larger shortening range and faster shortening rates

* Cardiovascular System

** Absorption and Filtration at the Capillary Bed


** Structure - Heart
*** Cardiac Muscle
- Located at walls of the heart
- Brancing chains of cells; uni or binucleate
- Striations

** Excitation / Contraction


** Regulation


** Pressure-Volume Loop


** Blood Pressure


# Exam 3
* Respiratory System
** Function of Respiratory System
- Overall Goal: to get O2 to the mitochondria and remove CO2 from the myoplasm

*** List of Functions
1. Provides O2
2. Eliminates CO2
3. Regulators blood pH in coordination w/ the kidneys
4. Forms speech sounds (phonation)
5. Defends against microbes
6. Influences arterial concentrations of chemical messengers by removing some from pulmonary capillary blood and producing and adding others to this blood
7. Traps and dissolves blood clots arising from systemic (usually leg) veins

** Design of Respiratory System
*** Airway Branching
**** Conducting Zone
- Trachea = 1 tube
- Bronchi = 2 tubes -> 4 tubes -> 8 tubes
- Bronchiole = 16 tubes
- Terminal bronchiole = 32 tubes -> 6x10^4 tubes

**** Respiratory Zone
- Respiratory bronchiole = 5x10^5 tubes
- Aveolar ducts
- Alveolar sacs = 8x10^6

*** Features
- Cilia most concentrated at the larynx -> bronchi, then decreases until 0 cilia at the aveolar sacs
- Goblet cells most at the larynx -> trachea, then less in the bronchi, then less in the bronchioles, then none from the terminal bronchioles -> alveolar sacs
- Most cartilage at the larynx and decreases until none at the bronchioles on
  - C-shaped cartilage at the trachea
  - Rings in the primary bronchi
  - Plates in the secondary bronchi, tertiary bronchi, and smaller bronchi
- No smooth muscles in the larynx, then more smooth muscle increasing until the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, then none in the alveolar sacs

*** Thoracic Cavity
**** Chest Wall
- Airtight, protects lungs
- Consists of rib cage, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm

**** Pleura
- Membrane lining of lungs and chest walls
- Consists of pleural sac around each lung and intrapleural space filled with intrapleural fluid (15 mL)

*** Steps of Respiration
1. Ventilation: Exchange of air between atmosphere and alveoli by bulk flow
2. Exchange of O2 and CO2 between alveolar air and blood in lung capillaries by diffusion
3. Transport of O2 and CO2 through pulmonary and systemic circulation by bulk flow
4. Exchange of O2 and CO2 between blood in tissue capillaries and cells in tissues by diffusion
5. Cellular utilisation of O2 and production of CO2

** Mechanics of Ventilation
- Inspiration :: Air flows into the alveolar sacs when Palv < Patm
- Expiration :: Air flows out of the alveolar sacs when Palv > Patm

F=(P_atm - P_alv) / R
Flow = (P_alv - P_air) * Conductance

*** Pulmonary Pressures
- Atmospheric Pressure :: P_atm
     - 760 mmHg at sea level
     - Decreases as altitude increases
     - Increases under water
     - Other lung pressures are given relative to P_atm (set P_atm = 0 mmHg)
- Intra-alveolar Pressure :: P_alv = pressure of air in alveoli
     - Given relative to P_atm
     - Varies with phase of respiration
     - During inspiration = negative (<P_atm)
     - During expiration = positive (>P_atm)
     - Difference between P_alv and P_atm drives ventilation
- Intrapleural Pressure :: P_ip = Pressure inside pleural sac
     - Always negative under normal conditions
     - Always less than P_alv
     - Varies with phase of respiration (-4 mmHg at rest)
     - Negative due to elasticity in lungs and chest wall
       - Lungs recoil inward as chest wall recoils outward
       - Opposing forces pull on intrapleural space
       - Surface tension of intrapleural fluid prevents wall and lungs from pulling apart
- Transpulmonary Pressure :: P_alv - P_ip = Distending pressure across the lung wall
     - Increase in transpulmonary pressure = increase distending pressure across lungs and causes lungs (alveoli) to expand, increasing volume

*** Pneumothorax
- When air can enter the pleural sac
- Causes an increase in P_ip, collapsing the lung
- Pressure becomes 0 everywhere

*** Breathing Mechanics
- Inspiratory muscles increase volume of thoracic cavity (diaphragm, external intercostals)
- Expriatory muscles decrease volume of thoracic cavity (internal intercostals, abdominal muscles)

**** Inspiration Steps
1. Neural stimulation of inspiratory muscles
2. Diaphragm contraction causes it to flatten and move downward
3. Contraction of external intercostals makes ribs pivot upward and outward, expanding chest wall
4. Collectively, thoracic cavity volume increases
5. Outward pull on pleura decreases intrapleural pressure, which results in an increase in transpulmonary pressure
6. Alveoli expand, decreasing alveolar pressure
7. Air flows into alveoli by bulk flow

**** Expiration Steps
1. Diaphragm and inspiratory intercostals stop contracting
2. Chest wall recoils inward
3. P_ip back toward preinspiration value
4. Transpulmonary pressure back toward preinspiration value
5. Lungs recoil toward preinspiration size
6. Air in alveoli becomes compressed
7. P_alv becomes greater than P_atm
8. Air flows out of lungs

** Lung Volumes and Capacities
- Static volume of lung measured with spirometer

*** Measurements
- Tidal volume (TV) :: Amount of air inhaled or exhaled in one breath during relaxed, quiet breathing
- Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) :: Amount of air in excess of tidal inspiration that can be inhaled with maximum effort
- Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) :: Amount of air in excess of tidal expiration that can be exhaled with maximum effort
- Residual volume (RV) :: Amount of air remaining in the lungs after maximum expriation; keeps alveoli inflated between breaths and mixes with fresh air on next inpiration

- Vital Capacity (VC) :: Amount of air that can be exhaled with maximum effort after maximum inspiration (ERV + TV + IRV); used to assess strength of thoracic muscles as well as pulmonary function
- Inspiratory Capacity (IC) :: Maximum amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal tidal expiration (TV + IRV)
- Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) :: Amount of air remaining in the lungs after a normal tidal expiration (RV + ERV)
- Total Lung Capacity (TLC) :: Maximum amount of air the lungs can contain (RV + VC)


** Ventilation Rate
- Ventilation rate = volume of air moved into and out of the lungs per unit time
- Can be expressed as minute ventilation or alveolar ventilation

- Minute Ventilation :: total rate of air movement into and out of the lungs (V_T x breaths/min)
- Alveolar Ventilation :: Minute ventilation corrected for physiological dead space

*** Equations
Minute Ventilation: V_Edot = f x V_T
Alveolar Ventilation: V_Adot = f x (V_T - V_D)
Dead Space Ventilation: V_Ddot = f x V_D, V_Edot = V_Adot + V_Ddot

** CO2 and O2 Exchange by Diffusion
- Fick's Law of Diffusion :: Flux = A * (delta PO2 / delta X) * D
- Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure :: Partial Pressure (p) = Fraction concentration * Total Pressure

- Diffusion of CO2 and O2 depends on partial pressures
- Alveoli -> Circulatory system -> Peripheral tissue

** Transport of Gas
- O2 has low solubility, so it requires hemoglobin to bind to it and carry it through the bloodstream

- Henry's Law :: C_x = P_x * X solubility
		 - P_x = partial pressure of gas (mmHg)
		 - Solubulity = solubility of gas in blood (mL gas/100mL blood/mmHg)

- O2 exists in blood as dissolved (2%) or bound (98%)
  - Dissolved form creates a partial pressure which in turn drives O2 diffusion
  - Presence of hemoglobin changes the equilibrium

** Control of Respiration
- Objective: To maintain normal levels of PO2 and PCO2 in arterial blood

*** Components
**** Sensors
- Chemoreceptors - Central and peripheral
- Pulmonary receptors
- Other Receptors

**** Central Controller
- Brain stem (pons, medulla oblongata)
- Cortex
- Other parts of brain

**** Effectors
- Respiratory muscles
  - Diaphragm
  - Abdominal muscles
  - Accessory muscles

*** Neural
**** Voluntary
- Cerebral Cortex

**** Autonomic
***** Medullary Centers
-Breathing rhythm generated by a network of neurons - Pre-Brotzinger complex
  - Have pacemaker-like activity
  - Rhythm produced by medulla and modified by inputs from pons

****** Dorsal Respiratory Groups
- Gives rise to inspiration
- Firing leads to contraction of inspiratory muscles
- Cease firing leads to passive expiration

****** Ventral Respiratory Groups
- Increased firing of dorsal neurons cause excitation of ventral respiratory groups
- Excites internal intercostals, abdominals, etc -> forceful expiration
- Do not activate expiratory muscles in normal, quiet breathing

***** Pontine Centers
****** Pneumotaxic Center (PC)
- Stimulation terminates inspiration
- Stimulated when dorsal respiratory neurons fire
- Inhibits inspiration
- Apneusis :: Brief expiration and long inspiration caused without PC

****** Apneustic Center
- Impulses from apneustic centre excites inspiratory area of medulla
- Prolongs inspiration

***** Effects of Lesions
- Pons - produces apneustic effect - long, powerful inspirations
- Above Medulla - irregular but rhythmic breathing
- Below Medulla - stops breathing since no automated output to respiratory system (death by hanging)

*** Chemical
- Negative feedback control system
- Controlled variables: blood gas tensions, especially CO2
  - CO2 levels affect breathing rate more than O2
- Chemoreceptor :: senses the value of gas tensions

**** Central Chemoreceptor
- Situated near surface of medulla of brainstem - rostral medulla (RA) and caudal medulla (CM)
- Responds to [H+] of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- CSF spearated from blood by blood-brain barrier (BBB) - relatively impermeable to H+ and HCO3-, but diffuses CO2 readily
- CSF less protein than blood, less buffered

**** Peripheral Chemoreceptor
- Extends down to the heart

**** Hyperventilation
- Low arterial PO2 causes hyperventilation

*** Summary of Factors Influencing Respiration
- Higher brain centers (cerebral cortex) has voluntary control over breathing (+/- rate)
- Other receptors (pain and emotional stimuli) act through the hypothalamus (+/- rate)
- Peripheral chemoreceptors detect drops in O2, rise in CO2, and rise in H+ (+ rate)
- Central chemoreceptors detect rise in CO2 and rise in H+ (+ rate)
- Receptors in muscle and joints (+ rate)
- Repiratory centers (medulla and pons)
- Stretch receptors in lungs (- rate)
- Irritant receptors (+ rate)

* Renal System (part 2 slide 19)
** Renal Functions
- Regulation of water and inorganic ion balance
- Removal of metabolic waste products from blood and excretes it into urine
- Removal of foreign chemicals from blood and excretes it into urine
- Gluconeogenesis
- Production of hormones/enzymes
  - Erythropoietin :: controls erythrocyte production
  - Renin :: enzyme that ontrols formation of angiotensin and influences BP and Na+ balance
  - 1,25-dihydroyvitamin D :: influences Ca+2 balance

** Structure
*** Kidneys
- Renal pyramid: Nephron -> Collecting duct -> Papilla -> Minor calyx
  - Renal Cortex (Nephrons)
  - Renal medulla (Collecting duct, papilla, minor calyx)

*** Urinary System
- Flow: Kidney -> Ureter -> Bladder -> Urethra

*** Nephron
- Proximal convoluted tubule mostly reabsorbs NaCl and NaHCO3

*** Tubular Epithelium
- Tubular lumen is surrounded by tubular epithelial cells
- Tight junctions between epithelial cells allow for transfer between lumen and peritubular capillary
- Interstitial fluid outside the lumen

*** Blood Supply
- Renal arteries enter kidney at hilus
- Receives 20% of cardiac output at rest
  - Less than 1% of body weight
  - 16% of ATP usage
  - Filters blood
- Renal veins exit at hilus

** Basic Renal Processes
*** Components of Renal Function
1. Glomerular filtration: glomerular capillary to Bowman's space
2. Tubular secretion: peritubular capilary to tubule
3. Tubular reabsorption: tubule to peritubular capillary

*** Renal Handling
- Substance X is filtered and secreted but not reabsorbed (all goes to urine)
- Substance Y is filtered and some of it is reabsorbed (some goes to urine, some goes to capillaries)
- Substance Z is filtered and completely reabsorbed (all of it goes to capillaries)

*** Excretion
- Substance can gain entry to tubule and be excreted in urine by glomerular filtration or tubular secretion or both
- Amount secreted = amount filtered + amount secreted - amount reabsorbed
- Excretion rate = V x U_x
  - Excretion rate = amount of X excreted per minute (mg/min)
  - V = urine flow rate (mL/min)
  - U_x = urine concentration of X (mg/mL)

*** Renal Clearance
- Clearance :: general concept that describes the rate at which substances are removed or cleared from plasma
- Renal clearance :: the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance by the kidneys per unit time (mL/min)
- Substances with highest renal clearances may be completely removed on a single pass of blood through the kidneys
- Substance with lowest renal clearances are not removed at all

- Renal Plasma Clearance: C_s = GFR + secretion_s - reabsorption_s = (V x [U]_x) / [P]_x
  - If C_s > GFR, then secretion_S > reabsorption_s and secretion > 0
  - IF C_s < GFR, then reabsorption_s > secretion_s and reabsorption > 0
  
  - V = urine flow rate per min (mL/min)
  - U = concentration of substance X in urine (mg/mL)
  - P = concentration of substance X in plasma (mg/mL)

**** Clearance of Some Substances
- Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) - both filtered and secreted therefore has the highest clearance
- Glucose - filtered and completely reabsorbed, renal clearance is zero
- Urea - filtration greater than excretion (net reabsorption)
- Penicillin - excretion is greater than filtration (net secretion)
- Insulin - GFR * Insulin concentration = total insuline filtered = 7.5 L/h * 4 mg/L = 30 mg/h - no reabsorption of insulin, no secretion of insulin

***** Clearance Ratio
- Clearance ratio of X = C_x / C_in

- C_x / C_insulin = 1.0
  - Cleance of x = clearance of insulin
  - Substance must be glomerular marker (filtered, but neither reabsorbed nor secreted)
- C_x / C_insulin < 1.0
  - Clearance of x < clearance of insulin
  - Substance is not filtered or it is filtered and reabsorbed (glucose)
- C_x / C_insulin > 1.0 
  - Clearance of x > clearance of insulin
  - Substane is filtered and secreted (PAH)

*** Renal Blood Flow
- Kidney receives about 20-25% of cardiac output, amongst the highest of all organ systems

**** Measurement
- Not all blood delivered to glomeruli is filtered in the glomerular capsule
  - Most of glomerular blood passes to the efferent arterioules
  - 20% renal plasma flow filtered - substances are returned back to blood
- Substances in unfiltered blood must be secreted into tubules to be cleared by active transport (PAH example)
  - PAH can be used to measure renal plasma flow
- Filtration and secretion clear only the molecules dissolved in plasma
  - PAH clearance actually measures renal plasma flow

*** Glomerular Filtration
**** Glomerular Filtration Pressure
***** Starling Force
- Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
- Bowman's capsule oncotic pressure
- Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure
- Glomerular oncotic pressure

**** Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
- Glomerular capillary to Bowman's space
- Movement of protein-free plasma from glomerulus to Bowman's capsule
- Must cross 3 barriers to enter Bowman's capsule: capillary endothelial layer, surrounding epithelial layer, basement membrane sandwiched between layers

- If a substance is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by tubule, the amount excreted in urine/min = amount filtered out of the glomeruli/min
- Rate at which substance is filtered by the glomeruli can be calculated: Quantity filtered = GFR x [P]_insulin where [P] = insulin concentration in plasma
- Amount filtered = amount excreted
- GFR = (V x [U]_insulin) / [P]_insulin

- Renal plasma flow = 625 mL/min
- GFR = 125 mL/min or 180 L/day
  - V = urine flow rate per min (mL/min)
  - U = concentration of substance X in urine (mg/mL)
  - P = concentration of substance X in plasma (mg/mL)

***** Forces
- Favoring filtration: Glomerular capillary BP (P_GC) = 60 mmHg
- Opposing filtration: Fluid pressure in Bowman's space (P_BS) = 15 mmHg, Osmotic force due to protein in plasma (pi_GC) = 29 mmHg
- Net glomerular filtration pressure = (P_GC + pi_BC) - (P_BS + pi_GC) = (60 + 0) - (15 + 29) = 16 mmHg

***** Systemic Capillary Forces
- Filtration pressure = 2 mmHg
- Filtration rate = 3 L/day

**** Glomerular Filtration Fraction
- How much of the renal plasma flow (RPF) gets filtered into the Bowman's space
- Only 20% of plasma that passes through the glomerulus is filtered, less than 1% of fitlered fluid is excreted

***** Renal plasma flow (RPF)
- Measurement: use a substance that gets completely secreted but not reabsorbed (PAH)
  - C_PAH = RPF
  - Controlled by arteriole dilation or constriction

***** Process
1. Plasma volume enters afferent arteriole = 100% plasma volume
2. 20% of volume filters at the Bowman's capsule
3. >19% of volume is reabsorbed into peritubular capillaries
4. 99% of plasma entering kidney returns to systemic circulation
5. <1% of volume is excreted to external environment

***** Calculation
- 625 mL plasma enters kidneys per minute (Plasma flow rate)
- 125 mL filtered into Bowman's capsule (GFR)
- Filtration Fraction = GFR / renal plasma flow = 125 / 625 = 0.20 = 20%

*** Reabsorption and Secretion
- Filtered load = GFR x [P]_x
- Excretion rate = V x [U]_x
- Reabsorption rate = Filtered load - excretion rate
- Secretion rate = Excretion rate - filtered load

**** Locations
1. Proximal tubule (cortex): 
   - Active: NaCl, H+, Nutrients
   - Passive: HCO3-, H2O, NH2, K+
2. Descending limb of loop of Henle (outer medulla): 
   - Passive: H2O
3. Thin segment of ascending limb (inner medulla): 
   - Passive: NaCl
3. Thick segment of ascending limb (outer medulla): 
   - Active: NaCl
4. Distal tubule (cortex):
   - Active: NaCl, K+, H+, HCO3-
   - Passive: H2O
5. Collecting duct (Inner medulla):
   - Passive: Urea, H2O

** Renal Handling
*** Glucose
- Glucose is transported from the lumen to the blood through proximal tubule cells
- Tm is peak of reabsorption
- Threshold is where excretion begins

**** Glucosuria
- Excretion of spilling of glucose in urine

***** Causes
- Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus :: lack of insulin causes plasma concentration of glucose to increase to abnormally high level
- Pregnancy :: GFR is increased, increasing filtered load of glucose to the extent that it may exceed the reabsorption capacity
- Congenital abnormalities of Na+-glucose contransporter :: Decreases Tm

*** Na+
-Daily Intake and Loss: Intake and Output should be equal
  - Intake: Food = 10.50g
  - Output: Sweat (0.25g) + Feces (0.25g) + Urine (10.00g) = 10.50g
- Na+ concentration in ECF determines ECF volume, blood volume, and blood pressure
- Na+ balance :: the act of the kidneys matching Na+ excretion and intake
- CHanges in Na+ concentration usually caused by changes in body water content, not Na+ content

**** Effects
- Excretion < intake :: positive Na+ balance, extra Na+ retained in the body (ECF) -> ECF volume expands, blood volume and arterial pressure increase -> edema
- Excretion > intake :: negative Na+ balance, excess Na+ lost -> ECF volume contraction, blood volume and arterial pressure decreases

***** Decreased Na+ Intake
- ECF volume and EABV (effective arterial blood volume) down
- Sympathetic activity up -> constriction of afferent arterioles, Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- ANP down -> Dilation of efferent arterioles, Na+ reabsorption (collecting ducts)
- pi_c up -> Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone up -> Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule and collecting ducts)
- End Result: Na+ excretion down

***** Increased Na+ Intake
- ECF volume and EABV up
- Sympathetic activity down -> dilation of afferent arterioles, less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- ANP up -> Constriction of efferent arterioles, less Na+ reabsorption (collecting ducts)
- pi_c down -> less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone down -> less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule and collecting ducts)
- End Result: Na+ excretion up

**** Distribution of Water
- Total body water (60% body weight) -> ICF (40% body weight or 24 L) and ECF (20% body weight or 12 L)
- ECF: Interstitial fluid (9 L) or Vascular fluid (3 L)
- Body weight of 60 kg (water density = 1 g/mL)

**** Handling in the nephron
- 67% reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubules - multiple ion transfers
- 25% reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb - Na+ is sent through a channel with 2 Cl- and K+ int cell, then a Na-K pump
- 5% reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule - Na+ sent through a channel with Cl-, then a Na-K pump
- 3% reabsorbed in the late distale convoluted tubule/collecting ducts - Na+ sent through ENaC while K+ is released
  - In the collection duct, Na+ and K+ are diffused in and out of the cell, then ATP pump sends it out into the ICF
- <1% excreted
- Regulated by aldosterone - induces reabsorption by inducing the expression of Sgk1 which increasing ENaC density at the membrane

**** Renin-Angiotensin System
- Liver secretes angiotensinogen which activates angiotensin I
- Kidneys secrete renin which activates angiotensin I
- Converting enzyme turns angiotensin I into angiotension II
- Angiotensin II causes adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone

***** Aldosterone Production
- Produced by adrenal glands, activation of a hormone cascade
- Stimulated by low BP and low blood volume
- Targets distal tubules and collecting duct to reabsorb Na+ and water
- When aldosterone is absent, 3% of filtered Na+ is excreted
- When aldosterone is high, almost all Na+ is reabsorbed
- Causes decreased urine volume and increases urine concentration

****** Pathway
Liver -> Angiotensinogen -> angiotensin I -> angiotensin II -> adrenal gland -> aldosterone -> increased Na+, H2O reabsorption in distal tubules -> BP and volume homeostasis
Stimulus: Low blood volume or pressure -> kidney -> renin -> angiotensin I -> angiotensin II -> eventual homeostasis

******* Alternate Pathways
Common start: Plasma volume goes down

Path 1: Renal sympathetic nerve activity goes up -> Renin secretion goes up
Path 2: Arterial pressure goes down -> Renin secretion goes up
Path 3: GFR goes down, decreasing flow -> Renin secretion goes up

Common path: Renin secretion goes up -> Plasma renin up -> Plasma angiotensin II up -> adrenal cortex increases aldosterone secretion -> plasma aldosterone up -> cortical collecting ducts increases Na+ and H2O reabsorption -> Na+ and H2O excretion down

***** Hormones
- Renin: released by JG cells, stimulated by sympathetic neurons, BP ad flow
- Aldosterone: released from adrenal cortex, stimulated by AngII and [K]

**** Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)
- Secreted when abnormal increase in blood volume stretches out the atria
- ANP promotes vasodilation, increasing GFR, inhibits Na+ reabsorption
  - Causes increased urine volume as it decreases blood volume

*** Ca+2


*** H2O
- 99% absorbed
- Intake (food, drink, metabolism) = Output (skin, lungs, urine, faces)
- AQPs throughout the kidney

- Osmoregulation :: maintaining body fluid osmolarity around 290-300 mOsm/L
- Small deviations in osmolarity produces hormone changes
- Control is exterted at the later distal tubule and collecting duct

**** Balance Terms
- Normovolemia :: normal blood volume
- Hypervolemia :: high blood volume due to positive water balance
- Hypovolemia :: low blood volume due to negative water balance

**** Osmolarity Terms
- Isosmotic :: 300 mOsm/L
- Hyperosmotic :: > 300 mOsm/L
- Hyposmotic :: < 300 mOsm/L

**** Osmolarity Changes
1. Isosmotic fluid leaving proximal tubule becomes progressively more concentrated in descending limb
2. Solute removal in thick ascending limb creates hyposmotic fluid
3. Water and solute permeability regulated by hormones in cortex medulla
4. Urine osmolarity depends on reabsorption in collecting duct

- General trends: Lower osmolarity at proximal tubule, higher at the loop of Henle
- Countercurrent multiplication: NaCl leaving the ascending tubule causes osmolarity to be higher in the descending tubule

**** Urea
- Generated by liver
- Eliminates nitrogen
- Extremely water soluble
- Requires urea transporters
- Transport from filtrate to peritubular fluid accounts for 40% of osmolarity gradient

**** Vasa Recta
- Prevents diffusion of water and solutes from dissipating the medullary osmotic gradient
- Descending limb: 300 mOsm, water leaves and solutes enter
- Ascending limb: 325 mOsm, water enters plasma, solutes move into interstitial fluid, no urea transporters

* GI
** Function of Intestine
- Digestion and reabsorption of substances
- Maintain fluidity
- Lubrication

*** Villi
- Filled with capillaries so it can absorb substances

** Digestion of Lipids
- Trigylcerides: needs lingual, gastric, and pancreatic lipases
- Cholesterol ester: needs cholesterol ester hydrolase
- Phospholipid: Needs phospholipase A_2

- Bile salts coat lipids to make emulsions (droplets)
- Micelles form from bile salts, phospholipids, fatty acids, cholesterol, and glycerides
- Micelle diffused into epithelial cell and then broken down

** Function of Stomach
- Mixes and pushes materials
- Secretes HCl, pepsinogen, mucus, gastrin, histamine

*** Acid production and regulation
- Pepsinogen secreted from parietal cells
- Combined with Hcl produces pepsin, which acts as a regulator and breaks down proteins
- Movement of carbonic acid causes subsequent movement of gastric lumen which results from active transport

- Ach, Gastrin, and Histamine cause release of acid

** Function of Pancreas
- Excretes insulin and glucagons
- Secretes pancreatic juices for digesting food in the small intestine

** Hormone regulation
*** Secretin
- Stimulated release by acid chyme in stomach
- Stimulates pancrease to make sodium bicarbonate, neutralising acidic chyme
- Stimulates liver to produce bile

*** GIP
- Released when endocrine cells are stimulated by food in the duodenum
- Opposite of gastrin -> slows digestion

*** Gastrin
- Released when stretch receptors triggered
- Taken in by CCK_B receptor
- Causes release of H+ which then turns into HCl in the stomach

*** CCK
- Stimulated by presence of food in duodenum
- Stimulates gallbladder to release bile
- Stimulates pancrease to produce pancreatic enyzmes

- Slower response

**** Initial Steps
1. First exposure to the antigen
2. Antigens are engulfed and displayed by dendritic cells
3. Helper T cells activate a humoral response and cell-mediate response (both happen) by releasing interleukin-2

**** Humoral (Antibody) Response
- Antibodies defend against infection in body fluids
- Use of B cells and antibodies with live virus-infected host cells

***** Steps
1. Helper T cell and intact antigens give rise to B cells
2. B cells give rise to plasma cells and memory B cells
3. Plasma cells secrete antibodies that defend against pathogens and toxins in the ECF

**** Cell-mediated Response
- Cytotoxic lymphocytes defend against infection in body 
- Use of T cells with dead virus-infect cells

***** Steps

1.5. Antigens displayed by infected cells activate cytotoxic T cells
2. Cytotoxic T cells give rise to memory cytotoxic T cells and active cytotoxic T cells
3. Active cytotoxic T cells defend against infected cells, cancer cells, and transplanted tissue

** Inflammation

4. More leukocytes migrate to area
5. Leukocytes clear infection

** Complement System
- Plasma proteins that lyse foreign cells, especially bacteria
- Part of response to antibodies (specific immunity) in addition to nonspecific response
- Approximately 30 proteins participate in the response cascade, resulting in MAC reaching the bacteria surface
- MAC pierces the bacterial membrane causing lysis

*** MAC Complex Formation

- Inflammation

** Lymphatic System
*** Blood
- Plays important role in acquired defense system

**** Lymphocytes
***** Life Events
- Generation of lymphocyte diversity through gene rearragement
- Testing and removal of self active lymphocytes
  - Single progenitor cell gives rise to a large number of lymphocytes each with differet specificity
  - Potentially self-reactive immature lymphocytes are removed through clonal deletion
- Clonal selection of lymphocytes

***** Antigen Receptor
- Have antigen receptors that help to detect antigens
- Each half of the receptor is a heavy chain, bound by disulfide bonds to make one receptor
- Antigen binding site is also the variable region
- Constant region is the rest of the lymphocyte, where it attaches to the lymphocyte

***** B Cells
- Differentiate to form antibody-producing cells and memory cells

****** Receptor
- Forked/Y shaped antigen receptor
- Constant region is the membrane antibody
- Binds to specific, intact antigen
- Often called membrane antibodies or membrane immunoglobulins

****** Clonal Selection
- B cells that are bound to an antigen diffentiate in two ways:
1. Memory B cells
2. Plasma cells (effector cells) - secrete antibodies

****** Development
- Half of DNA is encoding the variable region
- Half of DNA is encoding the constant region
- Gene splicing causes a unique supergene to be the end result

******* Steps
1. VDJ joining - V segment, D segment, and J segment are placed next to each other
2. Transcription - B cell DNA to Primary RNA transcript
3. Splicing - Introns are getting removed to form the final mRNA
4. Translation - mRNA becomes heavy chain peptide

***** T Cells
- Kill virus-infected cells; regulate activities of other white blood cells

****** Receptor
- Straight antigen receptor
- Constant region is the T cell receptor (TCR)
- Consists of two different polypeptide chains
- Cannot bind to intact antigens directly
- Bind to small fragments of antigens that are bound to normal cell-surface proteins (MHC molecules)

****** MHC
- Each individual has 3 genetic loci for MHCI and MHCII- each with as many as 100 alleles
- A lot of variation in the actual MH protein between person to person
- No cell to cell variation, so each individual's MHC proteins will be the same

****** Cytotoxic T Cell
- Class I MHC molecules, found on almost all nucleated cells of the body, display peptide antigens to cytotoxic T cells
- Surface protein is CD8

******* Steps
1. Fragment of foreign protein (antigen) inside the cell associates with an MHC molecule and is transported to the cell surface
2. Combination of MHC molecule and antigen is recognised by T cell, alerting it to infection

****** Helper T Cell
- Class II MHC molecules, found mostly on dentritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (antigen presenting cells), display antigens to helper T cells
- Surface protein is CD4

******* Steps
1. Fragment of foreign protein (antigen) inside the cell associates with an MCH molecule and is transported to the cell surface
2. Combination of MHC molecule and antigen is recognised by a T cell, alerting it to the infection

***** Natural Killer
 - Attack and lyse virus-infected or cancerous body cells

*** Lymph Duct
- Conducts lymph

*** Lymph Node
- Lymph is filtered in the lymph node
- White blood cells inspect lymph for pathogens

*** Spleen
- Acts as a lymph node for circulating blood

*** Bone Marrow
- Where B cells mature
- All lymphocytes arise from bone marrow stem cells
  - Maturation location determines whether the lymphocyte will be a B or T cell

*** Thymus
- Where T cells mature

** Antigen
- Antigen receptor has antigen-binding sites that antibodies can recognise and bind to
- Both B and T cells have antigen receptors all over their membranes
- The antigen receptors recognise and bind to a small, accessible portion of the antigen called the epitope

*** Disposal
- Binding of antibodies to antigen inactivates antigen through the following methods:
  - Viral neutralisation (blocks binding to host) and opsonisation (increases phagocytosis) - Enhances phagocytosis
  - Agglutinations of antigen-bearing particles such as microbes - Enhances phagocytosis
  - Precipation of soluble antigens - Enhances phagocytosis
  - Activation of complement system and pore formation - Causes cell lysis

** Immune Response
*** Primary Immune Response
- Occurs on an animal's first exposure to an antigen
- When native lymphocytes encounter antigen for the first time, some are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into effectors, elimiinating the specific antigen

*** Secondary Immune Response
- Individual is exposed to a previously exposed to antigen
- Memory cells facilitate a faster, more efficient response

*** Graph of Time vs Serum Antibody Concentration
- After the first exposure, there is a longer delay period, and a slower rise
- Peak of the first exposure is lower than the second exposure
- After the second exposure, there is a shorter delay period, followed by a sharp rise
- Peak of the second exposure is higher than the first exposure
- In both exposures, the # of antibodies decrease naturally
- This graph of exposure trends is similar for all antigens

** Antibody Classes
- Differs in distribution and functions within the body

*** IgM
**** Features
- Most the common class of antibody produced in the primary response to antigen

**** Roles
- Neutralises antigen
- Agglutinates antigen
- Activates the complement proteins

*** IgD
**** Features
- Important as an antigen receptor on B cells

**** Roles
- Neutralises antigen
- Agglutinates antigen

*** IgG
**** Features
- Most common class of antibody in blood and major class of antibody produced in secondary responses
- Crosses placenta, so is important in fetal and newborn immunity

**** Roles
- Neutralises antigen
- Agglutinates antigen
- Activates the complement proteins
- Opsonises antigen
- Enhances the Natural Killer cell activity

*** IgE
**** Features
- Involved in allergies, such as hay fever

**** Roles
- Neutralises antigen
- Agglutinates antigen
- Binds to mast cells and basophils, causing them to release histamine

*** IgA
**** Features
- Cross the epithelial cells, so it is present on mucosal surfaces and in breast millk
- Important in newborn immunity

**** Roles
- Neutralises antigens
- Agglutinates antigens
