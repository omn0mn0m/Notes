* Basic Info
** Cell Theory
- All organisms are made of cells
- All living cells are produced by other living cells
- The cell is the most basic unit of life

** Cell Characteristics
- Membrane-bound
- Filled with cytoplasm
- Have DNA
- Have ribosomes

** Eukaryotic Cells
- Have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles

** Prokaryotic Cells
- Does not have nucleus and most do not have membrane-bound organelles

** Atoms
- Life uses ~25 elements
- Atoms are the smallest unit with properties of an element

** Chemical Bonds
- Bonds require differebt energies to break

*** Covalent Bond
- Sharing of electron pairs

**** Forming and Breaking
- Dehydration :: Removing a water and adding a bond
- Hydrolysis :: Adding water and removing a bond

*** Ionic Attraction
- Attraction of opposite charges

*** Hydrogen Bond
- Electrical attraction between covalently bonded H and electronegative atom

*** Hydrophobic Interaction
- Interaction of nonpolar substances in the presence of polar substances (esp water)
- Non-polar groups move away from water or adopt conformations to shield from water
- Often found in hydrocarbons
- Amphiphilic molecules have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions
- Hydrophobic interactions are a major driving force controlling self-assembly

*** Van der Waals Interaction
- Interaction of electrons of nonpolar substances
- Occurs between all substances, but most important between nonpolar substances, especially if substances are close to each other

** Properties of Water Molecules
- Cohesion of water molecules
- High specific heat
- Solid (ice) is less denese than liquid (water)
- Known as universal solvent

** Functional Groups
*** Negatively charged groups
- Carboxyl
- Phosphate

*** Postively charged groups
- Amino

*** Neutral polar groups
- Hydroxyl
- Sulfhydryl
- Carbonyl
- Aldehyde

*** Neutral uncharged groups
- Made of hydrogens and carbons

** Macromolecules
*** Lipids
- Triglycerides composed of fatty acids and glycerol

- Unifying feature of lipids is that they have no (or little) affinity to water
- Fats, phospholipids, steroids

*** Carbohydrates (sugars)
- Polysaccharides contain disaccharides composed of two monosaccharides

- Has an aldehyde or ketone group plus two or more hydroxyl groups
- Tends to form into a ring in aqueous solution

- Isomer :: monosaccharides that only differ in spatial arrangements, making minor changes in chemical properties but changing their recognition

*** Nucleic Acids
- RNA composed of nucleotides
- DNA composed of nucleotides

- Consists of monomers called nucleotides composed of three parts: nitrogenous base, 5-carbon sugar, 1+ phosphate groups
- Ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA
- Purines in adenine and guanine, pyrimidines in cytosine and thymine/uracil

- Dehydration reaction creates phosphodiester linkage with the phosphate at the 5' carbon and hydroxyl at the 3' carbon

**** DNA Bases
- Adenine (A)
- Thymine (T)
- Guanine (G)
- Cytosine (C)

*** Proteins
- Peptides composed of amino acids

- Unbranched polyers constructed from a set of 20 amino acids
- Formed by a peptide bond to make a polypeptide

**** Directionality
- Carboxy (C) group of one amino acid joins to the amino (N) group of another amino acid
- C-terminus and N-terminus

* DNA
- Double helix with a sugar/phosphate backbone
- Nucleic acid bases are inside the double helix
  - Must be purine + pyrimidine
  - A & T, C & G
- Runs antiparallel - 3' -> 5' on one side, 5' -> 3' on the other side

* Central Dogma
** Replication - DNA to DNA
- Copying of DNA before cell division
- Semiconservative :: complementary base pair rule means that one old strand can be a template for a new strand in double helix

*** Origin of Replication
- Specific sites on DNA strand are origin points for replication
- Marked by a short, specific nucleotide sequence for replication proteins to recognise for binding

- Bacteria have 1 origin of replication
- Eukaryotes have many (100s-1000s) of origins

- Has a replication bubble where the DNA is being unwound by proteins at a replication fork
- 2 replication forks per origin of replication

**** Proteins that Initiate Replication
- Helicases :: Untwists the double helix at the fork and separates the parent strands
- Single-strand binding proteins :: Binds to unwound DNA single-strand to prevent it from forming hydrogen bonds
- Topoisomerase :: Relieves twisting strain ahead of replication fork by breaking, swiveling, and rejoining DNA strands
- Primase :: Makes RNA primer
- RNA Primer :: 5-10 complementary RNA nucleotides to serve as a foundation to which DNA nucleotides can be added
		Essential for DNA to form

**** Synthesising a New Strand
- DNA polymerase III :: Adds DNA nucleotides to a pre-existing chain
     Requires: RNA primer, DNA template (parent) strand
     Attaches 5' phosphate group of unbound nucleotide to free 3' OH group of strand, extending via the 3' end

- New stand can only be synthesised in the 5' -> 3' direction
- Template strand is antiparallel, being read in the 3' -> 5' direction

***** Leading Stand
- Opening in 3' -> 5' direction
- Can get continuous 5' -> 3' replication
- Only 1 primer needed
- Fork continues to open as synthesis progresses

***** Lagging strand
- Other strand is opening in 5' -> 3' direction
- DNA polymerase must work in the direction away from the fork
- Synthesised discontinuously as a series of fragments (Okazaki fragments)
- Each Okazaki fragment needs its own primer

- DNA Polymerase I :: Replaces RNA nucleotides in primer with DNA nucleotides in the 5' -> 3' direction
- DNA Ligase :: Joins together neighbouring nucleotides in DNA segments

** Transcription - DNA to RNA
- RNA is usually single stranded, while DNA is double stranded
- RNA has uracil, while DNA has thymine

- RNA Polymerase :: Creates mRNA from DNA
		    - Unwinds DNA
		    - Creates RNA at the active site
		    - Rewinds DNA

- RNA polymerase binds to the promotor as teh start point, using the 3' -> 5' as the template strand

*** Signals
- Initiation :: Promotor sequence in DNA at -35 sequence and -10 sequence
- Termination :: Terminator sequence in DNA

*** Steps
1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Termination

*** In Prokaryotes
- RNA polymerase binds to promotor at -35 sequence, with sigma factor also binding to the polymerase
- RNA polymerase binds more tightly at -10 sequence, also starting to untwist the DNA
- Sigma factor leaves after 8-9 nucleotides have been polymerised
- Terminates when C-G stem loop forms or Rho protein moves along

*** In Eukaryotes
- Transcription factor (TF) IID and TFIIB bind to promoters (TATA), then RNA polymerase II is recruited with other TFII factors
- TFIIH is a helicase and opens the DNA helix using ATP
- C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase interacts with RNA to cap, splice, and add the poly-A tail at termination

**** Splicing
- Introns are removed, exons are spliced
- Done by snRNA/protein complexes
- Forms into a spliceosome, creates a loop with the intron, and excises it

**** Termination
- AAUAAA is recognised, followed by 10-30 nucleotides and ending in CA
- Cleaved after CA and capped with an OH group
- poly-A tail attached

** Translation - RNA to protein
- Translation done by ribosomes
- Ribosomes are created in the nucleolus
- 61 sense codons per 20 amino acids

*** Ribosomes
- Contain two subunits
  - Small subunit :: holds mRNA in place during translation
  - Large subunit :: where peptide bonds form
- Active site is ribosomal RNA which catalyses peptide formation

*** Signals
- Initiation :: AUG start codon in mRNA
- Termination :: UAA, UAG, or UGA stop codon in mRNA

*** In Prokaryotes
- Translation is tightly coupled with transcription

*** In Eukaryotes
- Translation is done separately in the cytoplasm
- GTP-bound initiation factors bind to 5' cap with small ribosomal subunit
- It finds AUG (start codon) and the initiation factors leave so large ribosomal subunit can bind

*** Process
- Ribosomal subunits clamp the mRNA with an attached tRNA carrying the first amino acid
- tRNA continues entering the ribosome and adding more peptides to grow the chain
- Stop codon is recognised by protein release factor, and the apparatus comes apart
