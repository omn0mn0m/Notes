* Respiratory System
** Function of Respiratory System

- Overall Goal: to get O2 to the mitochondria and remove CO2 from the myoplasm

*** List of Functions

1. Provides O2
2. Eliminates CO2
3. Regulators blood pH in coordination w/ the kidneys
4. Forms speech sounds (phonation)
5. Defends against microbes
6. Influences arterial concentrations of chemical messengers by removing some from pulmonary capillary blood and producing and adding others to this blood
7. Traps and dissolves blood clots arising from systemic (usually leg) veins

** Design of Respiratory System
*** Airway Branching
**** Conducting Zone

- Trachea = 1 tube
- Bronchi = 2 tubes -> 4 tubes -> 8 tubes
- Bronchiole = 16 tubes
- Terminal bronchiole = 32 tubes -> 6x10^4 tubes

**** Respiratory Zone

- Respiratory bronchiole = 5x10^5 tubes
- Aveolar ducts
- Alveolar sacs = 8x10^6

*** Features

- Cilia most concentrated at the larynx -> bronchi, then decreases until 0 cilia at the aveolar sacs
- Goblet cells most at the larynx -> trachea, then less in the bronchi, then less in the bronchioles, then none from the terminal bronchioles -> alveolar sacs
- Most cartilage at the larynx and decreases until none at the bronchioles on
  - C-shaped cartilage at the trachea
  - Rings in the primary bronchi
  - Plates in the secondary bronchi, tertiary bronchi, and smaller bronchi
- No smooth muscles in the larynx, then more smooth muscle increasing until the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, then none in the alveolar sacs

*** Thoracic Cavity
**** Chest Wall

- Airtight, protects lungs
- Consists of rib cage, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm

**** Pleura

- Membrane lining of lungs and chest walls
- Consists of pleural sac around each lung and intrapleural space filled with intrapleural fluid (15 mL)

*** Steps of Respiration

1. Ventilation: Exchange of air between atmosphere and alveoli by bulk flow
2. Exchange of O2 and CO2 between alveolar air and blood in lung capillaries by diffusion
3. Transport of O2 and CO2 through pulmonary and systemic circulation by bulk flow
4. Exchange of O2 and CO2 between blood in tissue capillaries and cells in tissues by diffusion
5. Cellular utilisation of O2 and production of CO2

** Mechanics of Ventilation

- Inspiration :: Air flows into the alveolar sacs when Palv < Patm
- Expiration :: Air flows out of the alveolar sacs when Palv > Patm

F=(P_atm - P_alv) / R
Flow = (P_alv - P_air) * Conductance

*** Pulmonary Pressures

- Atmospheric Pressure :: P_atm
     - 760 mmHg at sea level
     - Decreases as altitude increases
     - Increases under water
     - Other lung pressures are given relative to P_atm (set P_atm = 0 mmHg)
- Intra-alveolar Pressure :: P_alv = pressure of air in alveoli
     - Given relative to P_atm
     - Varies with phase of respiration
     - During inspiration = negative (<P_atm)
     - During expiration = positive (>P_atm)
     - Difference between P_alv and P_atm drives ventilation
- Intrapleural Pressure :: P_ip = Pressure inside pleural sac
     - Always negative under normal conditions
     - Always less than P_alv
     - Varies with phase of respiration (-4 mmHg at rest)
     - Negative due to elasticity in lungs and chest wall
       - Lungs recoil inward as chest wall recoils outward
       - Opposing forces pull on intrapleural space
       - Surface tension of intrapleural fluid prevents wall and lungs from pulling apart
- Transpulmonary Pressure :: P_alv - P_ip = Distending pressure across the lung wall
     - Increase in transpulmonary pressure = increase distending pressure across lungs and causes lungs (alveoli) to expand, increasing volume

*** Pneumothorax

- When air can enter the pleural sac
- Causes an increase in P_ip, collapsing the lung
- Pressure becomes 0 everywhere

*** Breathing Mechanics

- Inspiratory muscles increase volume of thoracic cavity (diaphragm, external intercostals)
- Expriatory muscles decrease volume of thoracic cavity (internal intercostals, abdominal muscles)

**** Inspiration Steps

1. Neural stimulation of inspiratory muscles
2. Diaphragm contraction causes it to flatten and move downward
3. Contraction of external intercostals makes ribs pivot upward and outward, expanding chest wall
4. Collectively, thoracic cavity volume increases
5. Outward pull on pleura decreases intrapleural pressure, which results in an increase in transpulmonary pressure
6. Alveoli expand, decreasing alveolar pressure
7. Air flows into alveoli by bulk flow

**** Expiration Steps

1. Diaphragm and inspiratory intercostals stop contracting
2. Chest wall recoils inward
3. P_ip back toward preinspiration value
4. Transpulmonary pressure back toward preinspiration value
5. Lungs recoil toward preinspiration size
6. Air in alveoli becomes compressed
7. P_alv becomes greater than P_atm
8. Air flows out of lungs

** Lung Volumes and Capacities

- Static volume of lung measured with spirometer

*** Measurements

- Tidal volume (TV) :: Amount of air inhaled or exhaled in one breath during relaxed, quiet breathing
- Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) :: Amount of air in excess of tidal inspiration that can be inhaled with maximum effort
- Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) :: Amount of air in excess of tidal expiration that can be exhaled with maximum effort
- Residual volume (RV) :: Amount of air remaining in the lungs after maximum expriation; keeps alveoli inflated between breaths and mixes with fresh air on next inpiration

- Vital Capacity (VC) :: Amount of air that can be exhaled with maximum effort after maximum inspiration (ERV + TV + IRV); used to assess strength of thoracic muscles as well as pulmonary function
- Inspiratory Capacity (IC) :: Maximum amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal tidal expiration (TV + IRV)
- Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) :: Amount of air remaining in the lungs after a normal tidal expiration (RV + ERV)
- Total Lung Capacity (TLC) :: Maximum amount of air the lungs can contain (RV + VC)

** Ventilation Rate

- Ventilation rate = volume of air moved into and out of the lungs per unit time
- Can be expressed as minute ventilation or alveolar ventilation

- Minute Ventilation :: total rate of air movement into and out of the lungs (V_T x breaths/min)
- Alveolar Ventilation :: Minute ventilation corrected for physiological dead space

*** Equations

Minute Ventilation: V_Edot = f x V_T
Alveolar Ventilation: V_Adot = f x (V_T - V_D)
Dead Space Ventilation: V_Ddot = f x V_D, V_Edot = V_Adot + V_Ddot

** CO2 and O2 Exchange by Diffusion

- Fick's Law of Diffusion :: Flux = A * (delta PO2 / delta X) * D
- Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure :: Partial Pressure (p) = Fraction concentration * Total Pressure

- Diffusion of CO2 and O2 depends on partial pressures
- Alveoli -> Circulatory system -> Peripheral tissue

** Transport of Gas

- O2 has low solubility, so it requires hemoglobin to bind to it and carry it through the bloodstream

- Henry's Law :: C_x = P_x * X solubility
		 - P_x = partial pressure of gas (mmHg)
		 - Solubulity = solubility of gas in blood (mL gas/100mL blood/mmHg)

- O2 exists in blood as dissolved (2%) or bound (98%)
  - Dissolved form creates a partial pressure which in turn drives O2 diffusion
  - Presence of hemoglobin changes the equilibrium

** Control of Respiration

- Objective: To maintain normal levels of PO2 and PCO2 in arterial blood

*** Components
**** Sensors

- Chemoreceptors - Central and peripheral
- Pulmonary receptors
- Other Receptors

**** Central Controller

- Brain stem (pons, medulla oblongata)
- Cortex
- Other parts of brain

**** Effectors

- Respiratory muscles
  - Diaphragm
  - Abdominal muscles
  - Accessory muscles

*** Neural
**** Voluntary

- Cerebral Cortex

**** Autonomic
***** Medullary Centers

-Breathing rhythm generated by a network of neurons - Pre-Brotzinger complex
  - Have pacemaker-like activity
  - Rhythm produced by medulla and modified by inputs from pons

****** Dorsal Respiratory Groups

- Gives rise to inspiration
- Firing leads to contraction of inspiratory muscles
- Cease firing leads to passive expiration

****** Ventral Respiratory Groups

- Increased firing of dorsal neurons cause excitation of ventral respiratory groups
- Excites internal intercostals, abdominals, etc -> forceful expiration
- Do not activate expiratory muscles in normal, quiet breathing

***** Pontine Centers
****** Pneumotaxic Center (PC)

- Stimulation terminates inspiration
- Stimulated when dorsal respiratory neurons fire
- Inhibits inspiration
- Apneusis :: Brief expiration and long inspiration caused without PC

****** Apneustic Center

- Impulses from apneustic centre excites inspiratory area of medulla
- Prolongs inspiration

***** Effects of Lesions

- Pons - produces apneustic effect - long, powerful inspirations
- Above Medulla - irregular but rhythmic breathing
- Below Medulla - stops breathing since no automated output to respiratory system (death by hanging)

*** Chemical

- Negative feedback control system
- Controlled variables: blood gas tensions, especially CO2
  - CO2 levels affect breathing rate more than O2
- Chemoreceptor :: senses the value of gas tensions

**** Central Chemoreceptor

- Situated near surface of medulla of brainstem - rostral medulla (RA) and caudal medulla (CM)
- Responds to [H+] of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- CSF spearated from blood by blood-brain barrier (BBB) - relatively impermeable to H+ and HCO3-, but diffuses CO2 readily
- CSF less protein than blood, less buffered

**** Peripheral Chemoreceptor

- Extends down to the heart

**** Hyperventilation

- Low arterial PO2 causes hyperventilation

*** Summary of Factors Influencing Respiration

- Higher brain centers (cerebral cortex) has voluntary control over breathing (+/- rate)
- Other receptors (pain and emotional stimuli) act through the hypothalamus (+/- rate)
- Peripheral chemoreceptors detect drops in O2, rise in CO2, and rise in H+ (+ rate)
- Central chemoreceptors detect rise in CO2 and rise in H+ (+ rate)
- Receptors in muscle and joints (+ rate)
- Repiratory centers (medulla and pons)
- Stretch receptors in lungs (- rate)
- Irritant receptors (+ rate)

* Renal System (part 2 slide 19)
** Renal Functions

- Regulation of water and inorganic ion balance
- Removal of metabolic waste products from blood and excretes it into urine
- Removal of foreign chemicals from blood and excretes it into urine
- Gluconeogenesis
- Production of hormones/enzymes
  - Erythropoietin :: controls erythrocyte production
  - Renin :: enzyme that ontrols formation of angiotensin and influences BP and Na+ balance
  - 1,25-dihydroyvitamin D :: influences Ca+2 balance

** Structure
*** Kidneys

- Renal pyramid: Nephron -> Collecting duct -> Papilla -> Minor calyx
  - Renal Cortex (Nephrons)
  - Renal medulla (Collecting duct, papilla, minor calyx)

*** Urinary System

- Flow: Kidney -> Ureter -> Bladder -> Urethra

*** Nephron

- Proximal convoluted tubule mostly reabsorbs NaCl and NaHCO3

*** Tubular Epithelium

- Tubular lumen is surrounded by tubular epithelial cells
- Tight junctions between epithelial cells allow for transfer between lumen and peritubular capillary
- Interstitial fluid outside the lumen

*** Blood Supply

- Renal arteries enter kidney at hilus
- Receives 20% of cardiac output at rest
  - Less than 1% of body weight
  - 16% of ATP usage
  - Filters blood
- Renal veins exit at hilus

** Basic Renal Processes
*** Components of Renal Function

1. Glomerular filtration: glomerular capillary to Bowman's space
2. Tubular secretion: peritubular capilary to tubule
3. Tubular reabsorption: tubule to peritubular capillary

*** Renal Handling

- Substance X is filtered and secreted but not reabsorbed (all goes to urine)
- Substance Y is filtered and some of it is reabsorbed (some goes to urine, some goes to capillaries)
- Substance Z is filtered and completely reabsorbed (all of it goes to capillaries)

*** Excretion

- Substance can gain entry to tubule and be excreted in urine by glomerular filtration or tubular secretion or both
- Amount secreted = amount filtered + amount secreted - amount reabsorbed
- Excretion rate = V x U_x
  - Excretion rate = amount of X excreted per minute (mg/min)
  - V = urine flow rate (mL/min)
  - U_x = urine concentration of X (mg/mL)

*** Renal Clearance

- Clearance :: general concept that describes the rate at which substances are removed or cleared from plasma
- Renal clearance :: the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance by the kidneys per unit time (mL/min)
- Substances with highest renal clearances may be completely removed on a single pass of blood through the kidneys
- Substance with lowest renal clearances are not removed at all

- Renal Plasma Clearance: C_s = GFR + secretion_s - reabsorption_s = (V x [U]_x) / [P]_x
  - If C_s > GFR, then secretion_S > reabsorption_s and secretion > 0
  - IF C_s < GFR, then reabsorption_s > secretion_s and reabsorption > 0
  
  - V = urine flow rate per min (mL/min)
  - U = concentration of substance X in urine (mg/mL)
  - P = concentration of substance X in plasma (mg/mL)

**** Clearance of Some Substances

- Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) - both filtered and secreted therefore has the highest clearance
- Glucose - filtered and completely reabsorbed, renal clearance is zero
- Urea - filtration greater than excretion (net reabsorption)
- Penicillin - excretion is greater than filtration (net secretion)
- Insulin - GFR * Insulin concentration = total insuline filtered = 7.5 L/h * 4 mg/L = 30 mg/h - no reabsorption of insulin, no secretion of insulin

***** Clearance Ratio

- Clearance ratio of X = C_x / C_in

- C_x / C_insulin = 1.0
  - Cleance of x = clearance of insulin
  - Substance must be glomerular marker (filtered, but neither reabsorbed nor secreted)
- C_x / C_insulin < 1.0
  - Clearance of x < clearance of insulin
  - Substance is not filtered or it is filtered and reabsorbed (glucose)
- C_x / C_insulin > 1.0 
  - Clearance of x > clearance of insulin
  - Substane is filtered and secreted (PAH)

*** Renal Blood Flow

- Kidney receives about 20-25% of cardiac output, amongst the highest of all organ systems

**** Measurement

- Not all blood delivered to glomeruli is filtered in the glomerular capsule
  - Most of glomerular blood passes to the efferent arterioules
  - 20% renal plasma flow filtered - substances are returned back to blood
- Substances in unfiltered blood must be secreted into tubules to be cleared by active transport (PAH example)
  - PAH can be used to measure renal plasma flow
- Filtration and secretion clear only the molecules dissolved in plasma
  - PAH clearance actually measures renal plasma flow

*** Glomerular Filtration
**** Glomerular Filtration Pressure
***** Starling Force

- Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
- Bowman's capsule oncotic pressure
- Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure
- Glomerular oncotic pressure

**** Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

- Glomerular capillary to Bowman's space
- Movement of protein-free plasma from glomerulus to Bowman's capsule
- Must cross 3 barriers to enter Bowman's capsule: capillary endothelial layer, surrounding epithelial layer, basement membrane sandwiched between layers

- If a substance is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by tubule, the amount excreted in urine/min = amount filtered out of the glomeruli/min
- Rate at which substance is filtered by the glomeruli can be calculated: Quantity filtered = GFR x [P]_insulin where [P] = insulin concentration in plasma
- Amount filtered = amount excreted
- GFR = (V x [U]_insulin) / [P]_insulin

- Renal plasma flow = 625 mL/min
- GFR = 125 mL/min or 180 L/day
  - V = urine flow rate per min (mL/min)
  - U = concentration of substance X in urine (mg/mL)
  - P = concentration of substance X in plasma (mg/mL)

***** Forces

- Favoring filtration: Glomerular capillary BP (P_GC) = 60 mmHg
- Opposing filtration: Fluid pressure in Bowman's space (P_BS) = 15 mmHg, Osmotic force due to protein in plasma (pi_GC) = 29 mmHg
- Net glomerular filtration pressure = (P_GC + pi_BC) - (P_BS + pi_GC) = (60 + 0) - (15 + 29) = 16 mmHg

***** Systemic Capillary Forces

- Filtration pressure = 2 mmHg
- Filtration rate = 3 L/day

**** Glomerular Filtration Fraction

- How much of the renal plasma flow (RPF) gets filtered into the Bowman's space
- Only 20% of plasma that passes through the glomerulus is filtered, less than 1% of fitlered fluid is excreted

***** Renal plasma flow (RPF)

- Measurement: use a substance that gets completely secreted but not reabsorbed (PAH)
  - C_PAH = RPF
  - Controlled by arteriole dilation or constriction

***** Process

1. Plasma volume enters afferent arteriole = 100% plasma volume
2. 20% of volume filters at the Bowman's capsule
3. >19% of volume is reabsorbed into peritubular capillaries
4. 99% of plasma entering kidney returns to systemic circulation
5. <1% of volume is excreted to external environment

***** Calculation

- 625 mL plasma enters kidneys per minute (Plasma flow rate)
- 125 mL filtered into Bowman's capsule (GFR)
- Filtration Fraction = GFR / renal plasma flow = 125 / 625 = 0.20 = 20%

*** Reabsorption and Secretion

- Filtered load = GFR x [P]_x
- Excretion rate = V x [U]_x
- Reabsorption rate = Filtered load - excretion rate
- Secretion rate = Excretion rate - filtered load

**** Locations

1. Proximal tubule (cortex): 
   - Active: NaCl, H+, Nutrients
   - Passive: HCO3-, H2O, NH2, K+
2. Descending limb of loop of Henle (outer medulla): 
   - Passive: H2O
3. Thin segment of ascending limb (inner medulla): 
   - Passive: NaCl
3. Thick segment of ascending limb (outer medulla): 
   - Active: NaCl
4. Distal tubule (cortex):
   - Active: NaCl, K+, H+, HCO3-
   - Passive: H2O
5. Collecting duct (Inner medulla):
   - Passive: Urea, H2O

** Renal Handling
*** Glucose

- Glucose is transported from the lumen to the blood through proximal tubule cells
- Tm is peak of reabsorption
- Threshold is where excretion begins

**** Glucosuria

- Excretion of spilling of glucose in urine

***** Causes

- Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus :: lack of insulin causes plasma concentration of glucose to increase to abnormally high level
- Pregnancy :: GFR is increased, increasing filtered load of glucose to the extent that it may exceed the reabsorption capacity
- Congenital abnormalities of Na+-glucose contransporter :: Decreases Tm

*** Na+

-Daily Intake and Loss: Intake and Output should be equal
  - Intake: Food = 10.50g
  - Output: Sweat (0.25g) + Feces (0.25g) + Urine (10.00g) = 10.50g
- Na+ concentration in ECF determines ECF volume, blood volume, and blood pressure
- Na+ balance :: the act of the kidneys matching Na+ excretion and intake
- CHanges in Na+ concentration usually caused by changes in body water content, not Na+ content

**** Effects

- Excretion < intake :: positive Na+ balance, extra Na+ retained in the body (ECF) -> ECF volume expands, blood volume and arterial pressure increase -> edema
- Excretion > intake :: negative Na+ balance, excess Na+ lost -> ECF volume contraction, blood volume and arterial pressure decreases

***** Decreased Na+ Intake

- ECF volume and EABV (effective arterial blood volume) down
- Sympathetic activity up -> constriction of afferent arterioles, Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- ANP down -> Dilation of efferent arterioles, Na+ reabsorption (collecting ducts)
- pi_c up -> Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone up -> Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule and collecting ducts)
- End Result: Na+ excretion down

***** Increased Na+ Intake

- ECF volume and EABV up
- Sympathetic activity down -> dilation of afferent arterioles, less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- ANP up -> Constriction of efferent arterioles, less Na+ reabsorption (collecting ducts)
- pi_c down -> less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule)
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone down -> less Na+ reabsorption (proximal tubule and collecting ducts)
- End Result: Na+ excretion up

**** Distribution of Water

- Total body water (60% body weight) -> ICF (40% body weight or 24 L) and ECF (20% body weight or 12 L)
- ECF: Interstitial fluid (9 L) or Vascular fluid (3 L)
- Body weight of 60 kg (water density = 1 g/mL)

**** Handling in the nephron

- 67% reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubules - multiple ion transfers
- 25% reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb - Na+ is sent through a channel with 2 Cl- and K+ int cell, then a Na-K pump
- 5% reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule - Na+ sent through a channel with Cl-, then a Na-K pump
- 3% reabsorbed in the late distale convoluted tubule/collecting ducts - Na+ sent through ENaC while K+ is released
  - In the collection duct, Na+ and K+ are diffused in and out of the cell, then ATP pump sends it out into the ICF
- <1% excreted
- Regulated by aldosterone - induces reabsorption by inducing the expression of Sgk1 which increasing ENaC density at the membrane

**** Renin-Angiotensin System

- Liver secretes angiotensinogen which activates angiotensin I
- Kidneys secrete renin which activates angiotensin I
- Converting enzyme turns angiotensin I into angiotension II
- Angiotensin II causes adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone

***** Aldosterone Production

- Produced by adrenal glands, activation of a hormone cascade
- Stimulated by low BP and low blood volume
- Targets distal tubules and collecting duct to reabsorb Na+ and water
- When aldosterone is absent, 3% of filtered Na+ is excreted
- When aldosterone is high, almost all Na+ is reabsorbed
- Causes decreased urine volume and increases urine concentration

****** Pathway

Liver -> Angiotensinogen -> angiotensin I -> angiotensin II -> adrenal gland -> aldosterone -> increased Na+, H2O reabsorption in distal tubules -> BP and volume homeostasis
Stimulus: Low blood volume or pressure -> kidney -> renin -> angiotensin I -> angiotensin II -> eventual homeostasis

******* Alternate Pathways

Common start: Plasma volume goes down

Path 1: Renal sympathetic nerve activity goes up -> Renin secretion goes up
Path 2: Arterial pressure goes down -> Renin secretion goes up
Path 3: GFR goes down, decreasing flow -> Renin secretion goes up

Common path: Renin secretion goes up -> Plasma renin up -> Plasma angiotensin II up -> adrenal cortex increases aldosterone secretion -> plasma aldosterone up -> cortical collecting ducts increases Na+ and H2O reabsorption -> Na+ and H2O excretion down

***** Hormones

- Renin: released by JG cells, stimulated by sympathetic neurons, BP ad flow
- Aldosterone: released from adrenal cortex, stimulated by AngII and [K]

**** Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)

- Secreted when abnormal increase in blood volume stretches out the atria
- ANP promotes vasodilation, increasing GFR, inhibits Na+ reabsorption
  - Causes increased urine volume as it decreases blood volume

*** Ca+2
*** H2O

- 99% absorbed
- Intake (food, drink, metabolism) = Output (skin, lungs, urine, faces)
- AQPs throughout the kidney

- Osmoregulation :: maintaining body fluid osmolarity around 290-300 mOsm/L
- Small deviations in osmolarity produces hormone changes
- Control is exterted at the later distal tubule and collecting duct

**** Balance Terms

- Normovolemia :: normal blood volume
- Hypervolemia :: high blood volume due to positive water balance
- Hypovolemia :: low blood volume due to negative water balance

**** Osmolarity Terms

- Isosmotic :: 300 mOsm/L
- Hyperosmotic :: > 300 mOsm/L
- Hyposmotic :: < 300 mOsm/L

**** Osmolarity Changes

1. Isosmotic fluid leaving proximal tubule becomes progressively more concentrated in descending limb
2. Solute removal in thick ascending limb creates hyposmotic fluid
3. Water and solute permeability regulated by hormones in cortex medulla
4. Urine osmolarity depends on reabsorption in collecting duct

- General trends: Lower osmolarity at proximal tubule, higher at the loop of Henle
- Countercurrent multiplication: NaCl leaving the ascending tubule causes osmolarity to be higher in the descending tubule

**** Urea

- Generated by liver
- Eliminates nitrogen
- Extremely water soluble
- Requires urea transporters
- Transport from filtrate to peritubular fluid accounts for 40% of osmolarity gradient

**** Vasa Recta

- Prevents diffusion of water and solutes from dissipating the medullary osmotic gradient
- Descending limb: 300 mOsm, water leaves and solutes enter
- Ascending limb: 325 mOsm, water enters plasma, solutes move into interstitial fluid, no urea transporters

* GI
** Function of Intestine

- Digestion and reabsorption of substances
- Maintain fluidity

*** Villi

- FIlled with capillaries so it can absorb substances

** Digestion of Lipids

- Trigylcerides: needs lingual, gastric, and pancreatic lipases
- Cholesterol ester: needs cholesterol ester hydrolase
- Phospholipid: Needs phospholipase A_2

- Bile salts coat lipids to make emulsions (droplets)
- Micelles form from bile salts, phospholipids, fatty acids, cholesterol, and glycerides
- Micelle diffused into epithelial cell and then broken down

** Function of Stomach

- Mixes and pushes materials
- Secretes HCl, pepsinogen, mucus, gastrin, histamine

*** Acid production and regulation

- Pepsinogen secreted from parietal cells
- Combined with Hcl produces pepsin, which acts as a regulator and breaks down proteins
- Movement of carbonic acid causes subsequent movement of gastric lumen which results from active transport

- Ach, Gastrin, and Histamine cause release of acid

** Function of Pancreas

- Excretes insulin and glucagons
- Secretes pancreatic juices for digesting food in the small intestine

** Hormone regulation
*** Secretin

- Stimulated release by acid chyme in stomach
- Stimulates pancrease to make sodium bicarbonate, neutralising acidic chyme
- Stimulates liver to produce bile

*** GIP

- Released when endocrine cells are stimulated by food in the duodenum
- Opposite of gastrin -> slows digestion

*** Gastrin

- Released when stretch receptors triggered
- Taken in by CCK_B receptor
- Causes release of H+ which then turns into HCl in the stomach

*** CCK

- Stimulated by presence of food in duodenum
- Stimulates gallbladder to release bile
- Stimulates pancrease to produce pancreatic enyzmes

* Immune System

- Acquired immunity: Making cells

** Removal of antigens

- Macrophages and phagocytes take in and destroy antigens

- How B and T cells undergo activation
- How everything activates each other
- CD4, CDH, class 1, class 2
- Primary, secondary response
