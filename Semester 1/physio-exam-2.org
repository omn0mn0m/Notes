* Sensory Physiology
** Basics
*** Central Nervous System

- Brain
- Spinal cord

**** Spinal Cord Horns

- Dorsal horn :: cell bodies of interneurons on which afferent neurons terminate
- Lateral horn :: cell bodies of autonomic efferent nerve fibers
- Verntral horn :: cell bodies of somatic efferent neurons

*** Peripheral Nervous System

- Cranial nerves
- Ganglia outside the CNS
- Spinal nerves

**** Divisions
***** Afferent (Sensory)

- Sensing external environment
- Sensing internal environment

***** Efferent (Motor)

- Autonomic nervous system
  - Parasympathetic division
  - Sympathetic division
- Somatic nervous system

*** Stretch Receptors

- Stimulation produces a receptor potential/generator potential
- Receptor potential will trigger a graded potential

**** Adaptation

- Tonic receptors :: slowly adapting receptors that respond for the duration of the stimulus (action potentials fire less rapidly)
- Phasic receptors :: rapidly adapts to a constant stimuls and turns off (action potential stops)

** Vision
*** Iris

- Controls amount of light entering eye cavities
- Contraction of radial or smooth muscles permits pupil diameter change
  - Parasympathetic stimulation of circular muscle causes pupillary constriction (bright light)
  - Sympathetic stimulation of radial muscle causes pupillary dilation (dim light)

*** Lense

- Concave surface has focal point in front of lense
- Convex surface has focal point behind lense
- Refraction of light causes mirror image
- Parasympathetic stimulation flattens the lense for distant viewing by relaxing the ciliary muscle to tighten the ciliary zonule
- Sympathetic stimulation bulges the lense for close vision by contracting the ciliary muscle and loosening the ciliary zonule

*** Retina
**** Outer Layer

- Contains retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors

***** Photoreceptors

- Most concentrated by the fovea, and gets less concentrated as you move away
- Rods :: Distinguishes light (black and white)
- Cones :: Distinguishes colour (red - L cone, blue - S cone, green - M cone)

**** Middle Layer

- Contains horizontal cells, bipolar cells, and amacrine cells

**** Inner Layer

- Contains ganglion cells and optic nerve axons

** Hearing
* Skeletal Muscle
** Structure

- Attached to bones or to skin (in the case of facial muscles)
- Single, very long, cylindrical multinucleate cells with obvious striations

- Epimysium -> Perimysium -> Fasicle -> Muscle Fiber -> Sarcomere -> Myofibril -> Protein Filament

*** Muscle Organ

- Consists of hundreds to thousands of muscles cells, connective tissue wrappings, blood vessels, and nerve fibers
- Connective tissue covered externally by epimysium

*** Fasicle

- Discrete bundle of muscle cells, segregated from the rest of the muscle by a connective tissue sheath
- Connective tissue surrounded by perimysium

*** Muscle Fiber

- Elongated multinucleate cell with a banded/striated appearance
- Connective tissue surrounded by endomysium

*** Filament Structure

**** TODO Myosin Structure
**** TODO Actin Structure
**** TODO Thick Filament
**** TODO Thin Filament
** Excitation / Contraction

- Contraction :: Activation of force-generating sites within muscle fibers (cross-bridges)
- Shortening of filament is based on a sliding theory where thin filaments slide along the thick filament
- Voluntary (Sensory input -> integration at brain -> motor output)

*** Excitation

- Controlled by motor neurons
- Neuromuscular junction between neuron acetylcholine vesicle and muscle cell plasma membrane
- Excitation triggered by the release of acetylcholine

**** Acetylcholine

- Released from vesicles in the axon terminal when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are activated
- Binds with nicotinic receptor for activating muscle or is metabolised by acetylcholinesterase
- Binding to receptor causes a Na/K channel to open, allowing Na+ to flow in and K+ to flow out

**** Excitation Steps

1. Ach is released from the axon terminal due to action potential and binds to receptors in the motor end plate, triggering an action potential in the muscle cell
2. Action potential propagates along sarcolemma and down the T tubules
3. Action potential triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum
4. Contraction steps

*** Types of Contraction

- Isometric :: No lengthening or shortening
- Concentric :: When muscle is actively shortening
- Eccentric :: When muscle is actively lengthening

*** Cross-bridge States
**** Relaxation

- Regulatory proteins inhibit actin-myosin interactions
- Few heads are bound to actin
- Sarcomeres can be stretched passively

**** Contraction

- Muscle is activated by calcium
- Thousands of sarcomeres shorten in series causing muscle to shorten
- ATP is hydrolysed and force is produced

**** Rigor (Dead)

- ATP depleted
- Heads are tightly bound to actin
- Strong actin-myosin interaction prevents stretching

*** Stages of Cross-bridge Cycle

1. Crossbridge binds to actin when energised by ADP + Pi (Calcium influx)
2. Crossbridge moves and uncocks when ADP + Pi is removed
3. Crossbridge detaches when ATP binds to myosin
4. Crossbridge energises and is cocked  when ATP is hydrolysed to ADP + Pi

- Actin acts to accelerate myosin ATPase

*** Role of Ca2+

- Ca2+ binds to troponin to regulate muscle contraction
- Causes tropomyosin to move, exposing the myosin-binding site on actin

- Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the muscle fiber
- Dantrolene inhibits Ca2+ release
- Small latent period between action potential and muscle fiber shortening occurs

**** Ca2+ Release Steps

1. Muscle action potential propagation down the T-tubule causes ryanodine receptor to open
2. Ca2+ released from lateral sac of sarcoplasmic reticulum
3. Ca2+ binds to troponin, removing the blocking action of tropomyosin
4. Contraction
5. Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
6. Ca2+ removed from troponin, restoring tropomyosin blocking action

** Force

- Force in series: force of one sarcomere
- Force in parallel: sum of the forces of sarcomeres in parallel

- Depends on cross-sectional area of the fiber

*** Factors
**** Crossbridges in parallel

- Force of each bridge is independent
- Force proportional to number of crossbridges per half-filament
- Forces on left and right side of thick filament don't sum

**** Sarcomeres in series

- Force is same in each sarcomere (links in a chain)
- Number of sarcomeres is total length / sarcomere length

**** Fibers in parallel in muscle

- Force generated by each fiber is independent
- Total force = sum(force / fiber) * # of fibers

** Speed

- Velocity of fiber shortening = (velocity of shortening of 1 sarcomere) * (number of sarcomeres in series)
- Longer muscle fibers have larger shortening range and faster shortening rates

* Cardiovascular System
** Absorption and Filtration at the Capillary Bed
** Structure - Heart
*** Cardiac Muscle

- Located at walls of the heart
- Brancing chains of cells; uni or binucleate
- Striations

** Excitation / Contraction
** Regulation
** Pressure-Volume Loop
** Blood Pressure
