* Intro to Physiology

- Physiology: the study of the functions of organisms
- Organ system: collection of anatomical structures that work together to carry out a specific function

** Body Organisation
*** Cell

- Smallest independent unit that makes up a living organism that are specialised in different functions

**** Major Types of Cells

- Neurons - Specialised to transmit information in the form of electrical signals
- Muscle Cells - Specialised to contract, generating mechanical force and movement
- Epithelial Cells - Continuous, sheetlike layer of cells in combination with a thin underlying layer of noncellular material (basement membrane)
- Connective Tissue Cells - Any structure whose primary function is to provide physical support for other structures

*** Tissue

- Collection of similarly functional cells

**** Major Groups of Tissue

- Nervous tissue
- Muscle tissue
- Epithelial tissue
- Connective tissue

*** Organ

- When two or more tissues combine to make a structure that performs a particular function

*** Organ System

- Collection of organs that work together to perform certain functions

** The Body Plan
*** External Environment

- Layer of epithelial tissue separates the external environment from the body interior
- Layer consists of skin, lung lining, GI lining, and kidney tubules

*** Internal Environment

- Most of body is not able to directly interface with external environment
- Blood is contained within epithelium-lined blood vessels

*** Body Fluid Compartments

- Most abundant substance in body is water
- Total Body Water (TBW) - total volume of fluid enclosed within outer epithelial layer
  - Intracellular Fluid (ICF) - Fluid inside the cells
  - Extracellular Fluid (ECF) - Fluid outside the cells
    - Plasma - liquid in the blood
    - Interstitial fluid - liquid outside the blood that bathes most of the cells in the body

** Homeostasis

- Maintenance of relatively constant conditions in the internal environment of the body
- Example of Homeostasis: glucose maintenance

*** Negative Feedback Control

- Regulated variable - value that must stay within certain limits
- Setpoint - normal desired value for the feedback loop
- If the regulated variable increases, then the feedback works to decrease it and vice versa

*** Positive Feedback Control

- The system responds in the same direction as the change

* Homeostasis

- Body's internal composition is constantly challenged by external factors and internal metabolic activities
- Homeostasis :: the maintenance of extracellular fluids (ECF) to be relatively constant
		 - Depends on mass balance
- Homeostasis and an essential feature of complex organisms and a central theme in physiology
- All organs act on the ECF to maintain homeostasis

- Equilibrium :: equal amount of substance between intracellular plasma  and interstitual fluid
		 - Gases, water, lipid-soluble substance (steroids, fatty acids) can transport through capillaries
- Steady State :: constant amount of substance in ECF and ICF compartments (input == output)
		 - Requires energy to maintain

** Factors Under Homeostatic Control

- Nutrients
- Gases
- Waste products
- pH
- Salt and other electrolytes
- Temperature
- Volume and pressure

** Control Center

- Relex :: Response made at a distance from target cell
- Local Response :: Response made at target cell
		    - Occurs only in the area of the stimulus, neither nerves nor hormones involved

** Efferent Division
** Reflex Arc

- Involves both nervous and endocrine system

*** Stretch Reflex Arc

- 1a sensory afferent neuron :: senses stretch and sends info to spinal cord
- alpha motor neuron :: sends information towards muscle
- Skeletal muscle fiber :: neuromuscular junction

- Stretch induces depolarisation, as does opening of mechanosensitive channels
- They combine to make a stronger signal

*** General Components in Order of Pathway

1. Integrating Center
2. Efferent Pathway
3. Effector
4. Response
5. Feedback
6. Stimulus
7. Receptor
8. Afferent Pathway
9. Loops back to integrating center

** +/- Feedback

- The goal of feedback loops are to maintain a setpoint
- Hierarchy of importance since not everything can be maintained at setpoint

- Negative Feedback :: Response counteracts the stimulus, shutting off the response loop
- Positive Feedback :: Response reinforces the stimulus, sending the parameter farther from the setpoint

** Glucose Regulation

- Negative feedback
- Setpoint: About 80 mg/100 mL
- Only liver stores and releases glucose into the blood

*** Glucose High

1. Stimulus: Rising glucose level (such as from eating carb-rich meal)
2. Integrating Center: Beta cells in pancreas release insulin into blood
3. Effector: Liver takes up glucose to store as glycogen, body cells take up more glucose
4. Response: Blood glucose declines back to setpoint, decreasing insulin release

*** Glucose Low

1. Stimulus: Dropping glucose level (such as from skipping a meal)
2. Integrating Center: Alpha cells in pancreas release glucagon into blood
3. Effector: Liver breaks down glycogen and releases glucose into blood
4. Response: Blood glucose rises up to setpoint, decreasing glucagon release

* Transport
** Simple Diffusion

- Does not require specific protein
- Solute transported with gradient (high concentration to low concentration)
- No ATP needed

- Occurs as a result of random thermal motion of molecules (random walk)
- Over time, molecules will spread to near evenly fill a compartment

- Flux :: the amount of material crossing a surface in a unit of time
	  - Net flux account for both directions combined
	  Net flux depends on:
	  - temperature
	  - molecular mass
	  - surface area
	  - medium (water vs air)

*** Distance versus Time

\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{2Dt}
\end{equation}

where x is distance diffused (cm), D is diffusion constant, t is time (s)

\begin{equation}
D=\frac{KT}{6 \pi r \eta}
\end{equation}

where K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature (K), r is molecular radius, n is medium viscosity

- Note that water is denser than air, so it is easier to diffuse in air (based on D constant)

*** Rate of Diffusion

- Fick's Law of Diffusion

\begin{equation}
J=PA(C_A-C_B)
\end{equation}

where J is net flux (mmol/s), P is permeability (cm/s), A is surface area (cm^3), C_A is solution A concentration (mmol/L), C_B is solution C concentration (mmol/L)

*** Permeability

\begin{equation}
P=\frac{KD}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

where P is permeability, K is partition coefficient, D is diffusion coefficient, delta x is membrane thickness

- A higher partition coefficient means a substance will more readily dissolve in a lipid bilayer

**** Diffusion Potential

- Potential difference generated across a membrane when a charged solute (ion) diffuses down its concentration gradient
- Created by the movement of only a few ions, and does not cause concentraiton change in bulk solution

*** Osmosis

- Movement of water through a membrane
- Not diffusion because it is driven by osmotic pressure difference, not concentration difference

**** Characteristics

- Always passive
- Unaffected by membrane potential
- Driven by osmotic pressure
- Response to solute concentratio gradient
  - Movement through aquaporins, protein channels

**** Osmolarity

- Concentration of osmotically active particles in solution

\begin{equation}
Osm=gC
\end{equation}

where Osm is osmolarity, g is number of particles/mol in solution, C is concentration (mmol/L)

- Isosmotic :: Two solutions with same calculated osmolarity
- Hyperosmotic :: Solution with higher osmolarity
- Hyposmotic :: Solution with lower osmolarity

**** Osmotic Pressure

- Van't Hoff Equation

\begin{equation}
\pi=gCRT
\end{equation}

where pi is osmotic pressure (atm), g is number of particles/mol in solution, C is concentration (mmol/L), R is gas constant, T is absolute temp (K)

- Water moves from low osmotic pressure to high osmotic pressure

- Van't Hoff Equation can be modified to include the extent to which a particular solute crosses a particular membrane (effective osmotic pressure)

\begin{equation}
\pi=gC \sigma RT
\end{equation}

where sigma is reflection coefficient (from 0 to 1)

**** Tonicity

- Function of the concentration of nonpermeating solutes outside a cell relative to concentration inside a cell

- Isotonic :: 300 mOsm
- Hypotonic :: Lesser than 300 mOsm, cell swells
- Hypertonic :: Greater than 300 mOsm, cell shrinks

** Facilitated Transport

- Requires specific protein
- Solute transported with gradient
- Does not require ATP

** Active Transport (Primary)

- Requires specific protein
- Solute transported against gradient (low concentration to high concentration)
- Requires ATP

** Cotransport (Secondary)

- Requires specific protein
- Solute transported against gradient
- Does not require ATP
- Driven by movement of cotransported ion down its gradient

** Countertransport (Secondary)

- Ion and second solute move in opposite directions

** Carrier-Mediated Transport
*** Features

- Saturation :: Carrier proteins have a limited number of binding sites for the solute
- Sterospecificity :: Binding site for solute on the transport proteins are stereospecific
- Competition :: Transporter can bind chemically-related solutes

*** Kinetics

\begin{equation}
v_0=\frac{v_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]}
\end{equation}

where v_0 is velocity, v_max is maximum velocity, K_m is constant

*** Transporters

- Carrier proteins open and allow solute to pass the bilayer when the solute is bound to the protein (example: glucose)

** Ions
*** Electrolytes

- Chemical and electrical gradients influence ion movement
- Chemical driving force goes from high to low gradient
- Electrical driving force goes to the side of the membrane of opposite charge

*** Determining Driving Force Direction

- If V_m < E_x, electrochemical driving force is going out of cell
- If V_m > E_x, electrochemical driving force is going into cell

*** Equilibrium Potential

- Membrane voltage for a particular ion at equilibirum (when the electrochemical gradient is 0 and there is not net flow)
- Excess anions on the intracellular side, excess cations on the extracellular side

**** Nernst Equation

\begin{equation}
V=\frac{RT}{zF}ln\frac{C_o}{C_i}
\end{equation}

where V is equilibrium potential (V as internal - external), C are outer and inner ion concentration, R is gas constant, T is absolute temperature (K), F is Faraday's constant, z is ion valence (charge)

Alternatively, ln can be replaced with 2.303log_10:

\begin{equation}
V=2.303\frac{RT}{zF}log\frac{C_o}{C_i}
\end{equation}

In most cases, z = 1, and $2.303\frac{RT}{F}$ is 61:

\begin{equation}
V=\frac{61}{1}log\frac{C_o}{C_i}
\end{equation}

*** Diffusion

- Ion diffusion through the membrane is done through protein channels

**** Leaky Ion Channels

- Randomly opens and allows ions to move along the concentration gradient (high to low)

**** Gated Ion Channels

- Voltage-Gated :: Opens due to voltage change
- Ligand-Gated :: Opens when a substance is bound to binding sites on the channel
- Mechanically-Gated :: Opens when a conformation change in the membrane, etc occurs, forcing it open

** Pumps
*** Sodium Potassium Pump

- Sodium-Potassium pump moves 3 Na+ out of the cell and 2 K+ into the cell every time it hydrolyses ATP
- Electrogenic :: Drives a net current across the membrane, creating an electrical potential that is often no more than 10% to the membrane potential
- Direct role in controlling solute concentration, regulating cytosol osmolarity

** Membrane-Bound Compartment Transport

- Transport of macromolecules

*** Endocytosis

- Phagocytosis :: Cell membrane engulfs particle, breaks off into phagosome, matures into lysosome, and breaks down particle
- Pinocytosis :: Cell membrane engulfs dissolved molecules, breaks off into endosome, and transports molecules to final destination
- Receptor-Mediated :: Receptor protein is bound by molecule, causing coated pit to change conformation and form vesicle

*** Exocytosis

- Secretory vesicle fuses to plasma membrane, releasing contents

* Chemical Messengers

Mechanisms of Cell Signaling:
- Direct contact between cells -through gap junctions
- Indirect communication through chemical messengers - messenger is released from secretory cell and received by receptor in target cell
  - Local:
    - Paracrine signaling - short distance, transports through diffusion
      - Autocrine signaling - cell signals to itself
    - Synaptic signaling - short distance, transports through diffusion
  - Long Distnace:
    - Endocrine signaling - long distance, transports through blood

** Target Response Strength

Depends on
- Messenger cocnentration
- Number of receptors per target cell
- Receptor affinity for the messenger

*** Up-regulation

- Receptor number increases on target cell
- May result from too little messengers
- Sensitivity to messenger increases

*** Down-regulation

- Receptor number decreases on target cell
- May result from excess messengers
- Tolerance to messenger develops

** Transport
*** Bloodborne

- Source and target located at a distance
- Lipophobic ligands dissolve in plasma
- Lipophilic ligands bind to carrier protein

*** Diffusion through interstitial fluid

- Source and target are close
- Ligand is quickly degraded

*** Receptors

- Nonpolar signals bind to receptor inside cell
- Polar signals bind to transmembrane receptors

** Endocrine System

- Crucial for cells from one region to communicate to distant cells to maintain homeostasis
- Body uses endocrine system and nervous system for long distance communication

- Endocrine target secretes a hormone that enters the blood
- Blood spans the distance to the target

** Hormones
*** Hormone Interactions

- Antagonism :: Effect when hormones oppose each other
- Additive :: Net effect equals sum of individual effects
- Synergistic :: Effect of two homrones favour each other but net effect exceeds sum of individual effect
- Permissiveness :: One hormone is needed to exert another's effect

** Stimuli for Release
*** Direct Inputs

- Ions or nutrients
- Neurotransmitters
- Hormones

** Organs that Release Hormones
*** Primary Organs

** What Kind of Stimuli (Glucose? Ca? Hormones? Neurons?)
*** Lipophobic Ligands (hydrophilic)

- Synthesis is independent of demand
- Stored in vesicles of source until needed
- Released by exocytosis

*** Lipophilic Ligands (hydrophobic)

- Synthesised on demand
- Immediate release from source
- Release rate depends on synthesis

*** Amino Acids (hydrophilic)

- Targets cell receptors on cell membrane
- All functino as neurotransmitters
- Synthesised within neuron and stored in vesicle until needed
- Released by exocytosis

*** Amines (mostly hydrophilic, except thyroid hormones)

- Targets receptors on cell membrane
- Made or derived from an amino acid and contains an amine group, with the product being determined by enzymes present in the cell
- Produced in the cytosol of the source and stored in vesicle until needed
- Released by exocytosis

* Nervous System

- Transmit signals within neurons via long axons
  - Signal in axon = action potential
  - Axon action potential spans the distance to target
- Between cells via the synapse

- Overshoot :: Development of charge reversal
- Depolarisation :: Ion movement reduces charge imbalance
- Repolarisation :: Movement back towards resting potential
- Hyperpolarisation :: Development of even more negative charge within cell

** Ion Movements

- Inward current (depolarisation) caused when positive ions go inside cell and negative ions go outside cell
- Outward current (hyperpolarisation) caused when positive ions go outside cell and negative ions go inside cell

- Cl goes the opposite behaviour of Na and K because it is negative

*** Comparing Membrane Potential and Nernst Potential of Ion

- If (Vm - Eion) = 0, driving force is 0 and there is no net flow/current
- If (Vm - Eion) > 0, driving force is positive and there is outward current (hyperpolarisation)
- If (Vm - Eion) < 0, driving force is negative and there is inward current (depolarisation)

** Nervous System Components
*** Central Nervous System (CNS)

- Brain
- Spinal cord

*** Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

- Afferent information (input)
- Efferent information (output)

** Cell Structure
*** Neuron

- Excitable cells
- Made of
  - Dendrites

** Types of Proteins that Localise in Different Parts of Neurons
** Produce
*** Resting Potential

- Potential when neuron is not active
- Caused by passive transfer of ions
- Negative

*** Action Potential

- Occurs when cell is depolarised
- Na-K pump is active
- Must reach threshold

*** IPSP
*** EPSP
** Synapse

- Site of communication between two neurons or between neuron and effector organ
- Neurons communicate using neurotransmitters

** Ion Channels

- Neuron has both gated and ungated ion channels

*** Leak Channels

- Always pen
- Throughout neuron
- Resting membrane potential

*** Ligand-gated Channels

- Open or close in response to ligand binding
- Dendrites and cell body
- Synaptic potentials

*** Voltage-gated Channels

- Opens or closes in response to change in membrane potential

**** Sodium and Potassium CHannels

- Throughout, but more in the axon (especially in the axon hillock)
- Action potentials
- Typically more Na+ extracellular and more K intracellular
- Na channels open fast and close fast
- K channels open slowly and close slowly

**** Calcium Channels

- Axon terminal
- Release of neurotransmitter

** Threshold Potential

- Potential target for when AP triggers
- Multiple action potentials above threshold will make a stronger signal

*** Refractory Period

- Absolute Refractory Period :: No new action potentials can be triggered
- Relative Refractory Period :: New action potential can be triggered if stimulus is way above threshold

** Calculating Membrane Potential

- Use Nernst equation
- Membrane potential is equal to Nernst membrane potential of an ion if membrane is only permeable to that one ion
- Resting potential is negative because of having many open K+ channels but few open Na+ channels

** Calculating Equilibrium Potential

Use Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

\begin{equation}
E_{rev}=\frac{RT}{F}ln\frac{P_k[K]_o + P_{Na}[Na]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_k[K]_i + P_{Na}[Na]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl]_o}
\end{equation}

** Autonomic Nervous System
