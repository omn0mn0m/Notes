Lecture 6, Slide 7

* Background
- Early Greek scholars (Hippocrates) thought the brain was involved in sensation and intelligence

** Galen
- Greek physician
- Brain structures: cerebrum, cerebellum, ventricles
- Ventricular Theory of Brain Function:
  - Ventricles :: Fluids move to and from the ventricles by the nerves for sensation and movement

** Descartes
- Mind/Body Distinction :: Human mind is controlled by the soul, which is different than the physical body
- Mental and physical health are separate
- Body ailments were physical
- Mental ailments were spiritual

** 17th - 18th Century View
- White matter is continuous with the nerves
- Brings info to and from gray matter

** 18th Century View
- Nerves were like wires -> electrical phenomena
- Bell and Magendie - thought that dorsal and ventral roots carried ions

** Phrenology
- Bumps on the surface of the skull reflect brain surface and related personality traits

** Brodmann
- 1868 - 1918
- Identifies multiple brain areas
  - Broca's area
  - Wernicke's area
  - Primary auditory cortex
  - Primary visual cortex
  - Primary motor cortex
  - Primary somatosensory cortex

* Neurons and Glia
- Brain tissue is composed of gray and white matter

- Gray matter :: neurons and glia
- White matter :: myelinated axons of neurons (also neurons and glia)

** Division of Nervous System
*** Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Central division
- Consists of: Brain and spinal cord

**** Brain
- 4 major lobes named after overlying cranial bones
  - Frontal lobe - Motor processing
  - Parietal lobe - Somatic sensory processing
  - Occipital lobe - Visual processing
  - Temporal lobe - Auditory processing

- Gyri :: bumps on the brain
- Sulci :: grooves on the brain
- Gyri and sulci are similar on individuals

- Cerebral localisation :: Different functions for different lobes and gyri

***** Primary Cortical Areas
- Each lobe has a primary cortical area
- Each area receives inputs that are relayed to the cortex through the thalamus

*** Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- Peripheral division
- Consists of: network of nerves that go throughout the body
- Conducts electrical signals to and from CNS

- Efferent neuron :: motor function, carries signal to muscles
- Afferent neuron :: sensory function, carries signal to the brain

** Histology
- Study of tissue structure

*** NissI Stain
- Stains nucleic acids, mainly RNA on rough ER (ribosomes)
- Facilitates study of cytoarchitecture
- Stains all cell somas

*** Golgi Stain
- Silver chromate solution stains small percentage of neurons in their entirety
- Stain shows 2 parts:
  - Cell body = soma = perikaryon
  - Neurites = axons and dendrites
- Reticular theory :: neurites of different cells fused into continuous reticulum (nerve net)

*** Cajal
- Histologist and artist
- Used Golgi stain and light microsope to draw neurons and neural circuits

**** Neuron Doctrine
- Neurons are the fundamental structural/functional unit of the CNS
- Neurons are discrete cells: connected but not continuous with other cells
- Neurons composed of 3 parts:
  - Dendrite
  - Axon
  - Cell body
- Info frlows along neuron in one direction: dendrite -> cell body -> axon

** Glia
- From the Greek "glue"
- Insulates, supports, and nourishes neurons (supports neuron functions)

*** Astrocyte
- Most numerous glia in the brain
- Regulate contents of extracellular space
  - Neurotransmitters
  - K+ spatial buffer
- Influence neurite growth
- Blood-brain barrier

*** Myelinating Glia
- Forms the myelin sheath for insulating axons

- Node of Ranvier :: Region where axonal membrane is exposed

*** Oligodendrocyte
- Found in CNS
- One cell can myelinate several axons

*** Schwann Cell
- Found in PNS
- One cell myelinates a signal axon

*** Microglia
- Act as phagocytes - remove debris left by dead or dying neurons/glia
- They activate following brain tissue injury

*** Ependymal Cell
- Lines the brains ventricular system

** Neuron
- Sense environmental changes (external and internal)
- Process info
- Communicate changes to other neurons
- Command the body's response to these sensations

- Neurites = dendrites + axons

*** Dendrite
- Short, stubby, and often spiny
- Highly branched tree
- Very tapered as it goes further from soma
- Receives signal

**** Structure
- "Antennae" of neurons
- Dendritic tree
- Covered with neurotransmitter receptors
- Some covered with dendritic spines

*** Axon
- Long, thin, smooth
- Fewer branches
- Diameter more uniform
- Sends signal

**** Components
- Axon hillock - initial segment (beginning)
- Axon proper - middle
- Axon terminal - end
- Axon collaterals - branches

***** Axon Terminal
- Presence of synaptic vesicles
- Site where axon comes in contact with other neurons or cells

***** Synapse
- Point of contact
- Information passed from pre-synaptic cell to post-synaptic cell

- Presynaptic membrane - belongs to the sending neuron (pre-synaptic)
- Postsynaptic membrane - belongs to the receiving neuron (post-synaptic)
- Synaptic cleft - area between

**** Axoplasmic Transport
***** Anterograde
- Proteins synthesised in the soma and shipped down to the axon terminal
- Uses Kinesin
- Slow: 1-10mm/day
- Fast: 10000mm/day

***** Retrograde
- Signals to soma about metabolic needs of axon terminal
- Terminal to soma transport
- Uses dynein

*** Soma
- Cell body

- Cytosol :: watery fluid inside the cell
- Organelles :: membrane-bound structures within the soma
- Cytoplasm :: contents within a cell membrane

**** Nucleus
- Chromosomes :: contain DNA
- Genes :: segments of DNA that code for specific proteins
- Gene expression :: reading of DNA resulting in synthesis of a protein

- Central dogma :: DNA --- transcription ---> mRNA --- translation ---> protein

**** Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
***** Rough ER
- Membrane with attached ribosomes
- Site of protein synthesis

- Free ribosomes :: produce proteins that are released into the cytosol and used within the cell
- Bound ribosomes :: on rough ER, usually produces proteins that are inserted into the plasma membrane

***** Smooth ER
- Folds proteins, giving them a 3D structure
- Regulates internal Ca+2 concentration

**** Golgi Apparatus
- Packages molecules and sends them to the appropriate destination in the cell

**** Microchrondria
- Site of cellular respiration - biochemical Kreb's cycle yields ATP, which is used for energy

**** Neuronal Membrane
- Membrane is a lipid bilayer, like other cells
- Polar heads on the inside and outside of membrane
- Nonpolar tails on the inside of membrane
- Inside of the membrane is non-polar, and charged ions cannot pass through it
- Protein pores or channels allow things to pass through the membrane

**** Cytoskeleton
- Internal scaffolding of the neuron
- Gives neuron shape

***** Components
****** Microtubule
- Dynamic (for plasticity)
- Forms long scaffolds down neurites
- Alzheimer's Disease - has abnormal tau protein

****** Neurofilaments
- Most abundant
- Very stable

****** Microfilaments
- Actin molecules
- Dynamic (for plasticity)
- Near plasma membrane

*** Classification
**** By Number of Neurites on Soma
- Single Neurite - unipolar (pseudounipolar) (DRG)
- Two or more Neurites
  - bipolar - 2 (retina)
  - multipolar - more than 2

**** By Dendritic and Somatic Morphologies
- Stellate cells - star shaped
- Pyramidal cells - pyramid shaped
- Spiny or aspinous

**** By Connections within the CNS
- Sensory neurons
- Motor neurons
- Interneurons

**** By Neurotransmitter Type
- Cholinergyic - acetylcholine at synapse
- Adrenergic - norepinephrine/epinephrine at synapse
* Membrane Potential
- When neuron is not generating signals, it is at rest
- Cytosol (inside of cell) has a negative charge compared to the outside

- Neurons can receive signals (normally on the dendrite)
- Neurons can generate signals (axon hillock)
- Neurons can conduct signals (axon)

** Signal Conduction
- Cytosol and extracellular fluid are made of water and ions
- Sphere of hydration :: Water molecules surround ions

*** Semipermeability
- Lipid bilayer acts as an insulator, preventing charged ions from passing through wihtout a pore

**** Ion channel
- Pore formed by proteins that are embedded in the membrane
- Differ in types of ions that they allow to pass through
- Cation channels - allow + ions, can be specific or not
- Anion channels - allow - ions

***** Gating
****** Leak Channel
- Passive channels
- Open at all times

****** Gated Channel
- Active channels that are selectively opened and closed based on changes
- Possible changes:
  - Voltage
  - Ligand
  - Phosphorylation
  - Mechanical Force
  - Light

** Resting Membrane Potential
- Voltage across a cell membrane for neurons at rest
- Leak channels contribute to resting potential
- Membrane is impermeable to large anions inside cell
- Movement of charged particles across a semipermeable membrane is what gives ries to a resting potential

*** Microelectrode
- Made by heating glass, which is pulled into the tip form

*** Ions at Resting Potential
- Excess of negative charge inside the cell, excess of positive charge outside the cell
- Results in around -70 mV

- Na+ : chemical driving force = in, electrical driving force = in, permeability = low
- K+ : chemical driving force = out, electrical driving force = in, permeability = high

- At rest, Na+ is leaking in while K+ is leaking out

**** Concentration Gradient
- One of two forces that govern particle movements across a permeable membrane

- Diffusion :: movement of ions from high concentration to low concentration

**** Electrical Force
- Charged particles respond to and create electrical force
- Charges exert an electrostatic force on other charges
  - Opposite charges attract and like charges repel
- Separated charges have potential energy
- Measure of potential energy = voltage
- Voltage always measured between two points as a potential difference

- Positive ions move towards the negative pole (cathode)
- Negative ions move towards the positive pole (anode)

- Current :: movement of charged particles
	     defined as movement of positive charge (opposite direction as negative charge)
- Conductance :: Movement of ions through channels

***** Ohm's Law
- Voltage (V) :: electical force exerted on a charged particle (measured in volts V)
		 difference in charge between anode and cathode
- Current (I) :: movement of charged particles per unit time (measured in amperes A)
- Resistance (R) :: difficulty for particles to flow (measured in ohms $\omega$)
		    inverse of conductance (g), which relates to permeability of ion channels

- Ohms Law :: I = gV or V = IR or I = g(V_m - E_ion)
	      If conductance = 0, then no current flow
	      If voltage = 0, then no current flow

**** Equilibrium Potential
- No net movement
- Chemical force and electrical force are equal

***** Some Notes
- Large changes in membrane potential are caused by minuscule changes in ionic concentrations
- The net difference in electrical charge occurs at the inside and outside surfaces of the membrane
- Ions are driven across the membrane at a rate proportional to the difference between the membrane potential (Vm) and the equilibrium potential (Eion) for each ion
  - Ionic driving force = Vm - E_ion

**** Nernst Potential
- Each ion has its own equilibrium potential. If the concentration difference across the membrane is known for an ion
  - Nernst Equation to calculate equilibrium potential :: E_x = 2.303 * RT/zF * log X_o/X_i
       - z = charge of ion
       - F = Faraday's constant
       - R = gas constant
       - T = absolute temperature
  - Nernst Equation at 37 C :: E_x = 61.5/z * log X_o/X_i

- Membrane voltage that would just balance the ion's concentration gradient so that there is no net ionic current
- Only accounts for permeability for that one ion

- Nerst potential = membrane potential -> no net current
- Difference between Nernst and membrane potential is driving force

**** Goldman Equation
- More than one ion: permeability taken into account, larger conductance will flow more
- Nernst equation with weighting added for the permeability/conductance

- V_m = 2.303 * RT/zF * log (P_Na * Na_o + P_k * K_o) / (P_Na * Na_i + P_k * K_i)
  - P_x is the relative permeability of an ion

- At rest, K+ is most permeable and resting membrane potential is closer to E_K than E_Na

***** Rules
- V_m > E_k -> Ion flows out of cell
- V_m = E_k -> No net flow
- V_m < E_k -> Ion flows into cell

*** Active Transport (Na/K pump)
- Pumps 3 Na+ out, pumps 2 K+ in
- Requires ATP for activation
- Maintains concentration gradient -> hyperpolarisation due to net outward flux of + ions

*** K+
- V_m is particularly sensitive to K+_out
- Increasing K+_out depolarises neuron

**** Regulation
- Elevated K+ -> depolarisation -> interferes with normal signaling
- Na/K pump
- Blood-brain barrier prevents excess K+ from entering CNS
- Glial cells (astrocytes) remove excess K+ from extracellular space

** Action Potential
- Action potential consists of transient change to membrane potential, traveling from the soma down the axon to the terminal
- Conveys info over distances - can travel a long distance without losing amplitude
- Moves by the opening and closing of Na+ channels along the axon
- Transient reversal (changing negative resting charge to more positive charge

- Neural code :: frequency and pattern of APs

- Active membrane properties due to movement of ions through voltage-gated channels
- Net Current Flow = conductance x driving force

- Hyperpolarisation :: membrane potential < resting potential
- Depolarisation :: membrane potential > resting potential

- Threshold :: critical level of depolarisation that must be reached to trigger action potential

- Optogenetics :: action potential firing in response to light

- Saltatory Conduction :: action potential semingly jumping node to node
- Spike-Initiation Zone :: high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels

- Differences in type and density of membrane ion channels account for characterstic electrical neuron properties
  - Adaptation
  - Rhythmic bursting

- Tetrodotoxin (TTX) :: blocks Na+ currents - positive current with no negative dip
- Tetraethylammonium (TEA) :: blocks K+ currents - negative current with no recovery

*** Parts of the Action Potential
- Rising Phase :: action potential going towards 0 mV
- Overshoot :: when membrane potential is over 0 mV
- Falling Phase :: action potential going back to resting potential
- Undershoot :: when membrane potential is lower than resting potential

*** Firing
- Firing frequency reflects magnitude of depolarising current
- AP is all or nothing, always the same size

- Ion mechanisms trigger by membrane potential reaching threshold

**** Ion Mechanism
***** Rising Action
- Na+ channels open, increasing Na+ conductance to be above K+
- Na+ voltage-gated ion channels open in response as positive feedback
- I_Na = net inward movement

***** Falling Action
- g_Na decreases again
- g_K increases by opening voltage-gated K+ channels
- K+ leaves the cell to repolarise it back to V_rest
- Resets in neuron

*** Experimental Measurement
**** Voltage Clamp
- Used to understand what causes changes in conductance that give rise to action potential currents

1. Internal electrode measures V_m and is connected to a voltage clamp amplifier
2. Amplifier compares membrane potential to desired potential
3. When V_m is different from reference voltage, amplifier inject current into axon through a second electrode
   - Causes V_m to be same as reference voltage
4. Current flowing back into axon/across membrane can be measured

- Outward current (above axis) shows hyperpolarisation
- Inward current (below axis) shows depolarisation

***** Hodgkin and Huxley
- Wanted to understand conductance changes (g_ion) during action potential
- Calculated the shape of an action potential
- Proposed the existence of gates in the membrane

1. Set V_ref on voltage clamp
2. Meusre currents necessary to keep V_m at V_ref
3. Calculate: g_ion = I_ion / (V_m - E_ion)
   - V_m and E_ion are knowns

- Na+ currents show faster activation
- Na+ currents inactivate, K+ currents do not
- Na+ and K+ conductances are voltage-dependent conductances

***** Patch-clamp method - Sakmann and Neher
- Measures currents through individual ion channels
- Pipette tip and Gigaohm seal pinch an individual channel and observe the current change

*** Molecular Mechanisms
**** Ion Selectivity
- Na channels and K channels

**** Voltage-dependent activation
- Activation gates

**** Voltage-dependent inactivation
- Inactivation gates

**** Voltage-gated Na channels
- Opens when membrane depolarises from -65 mV to -40 mV
- Twists S4 region to open gate

- Large protein with 4 domains, each has 6 transmembrane alpha helices
- Domains are connected by intracellular loops
- S4 is the voltage sensor of the channel

- Loop after S5 is the selectivity filter for Na+
- Selectivity filter works based on size of partially hydrated Na+ being smaller than partially hydrated K+

***** Mechanism
- Closed channel, twisted
- Opens on depolarisation, untwisted (activation gate)
- Inactivation gate, ball and chain covers the gate
- Deinactivation, channel twists back up

*** Refactory Period
- Absolute refractory period :: Na+ channels inactivated until membrane goes negative enough to deinactivate channels
- Relative refractory period :: Membrane stays hyperpolarised until K+ channel closes, more depolarisation required to reach threshold

*** Changing Propagation Speed
**** Axon Diameter
- Increasing the diameter reduces internal resistance
- Less ions in contact with membrane
- Little current leaks out
- More current down the axon
- Faster propagation

**** Mylenation
- Increases the membrane resistance
- Made of specialised glial cells wrapped around the axon
- Efficient insulator that allows almost no current leak

- Oligodendrocytes in CNS
- Schwann cells in PNS

- Voltage-gated channels concentrated at nodes of ranvier

*** Clinical Issues
- Demyelinating Diseases
  - Multiple sclerosis :: CNS disease
       Weakness, lack of coordination, impared vision/speech
       MS attacks myelin sheath in brain, spinal cord, optic nerve
       Cause poorly understood
  - Guillain-Barre Syndrome :: PNS disease
       Immune response against your myelin
       Attacks myelin of peripheral nerves innervating muscles and skin
* Synaptic Transmission
- Synapse :: functional connection between two cells (neuron -> neuron or neuron -> muscle cell)
- Presynaptic cell :: sends signal
- Postsynaptic cell :: receives signal

** Signaling Mechanism
- Axonal conduction of action potential
- Synaptic transmission

** Debate
- In 1921, Loewi demonstrated that synaptic transmission is chemical by stimulating a heart with solution
- In 1950-60s, microelectrode and electron microscope showed that transmission is both electrical and chemical

*** Over Cell Anatomy
- Reticular theory :: neurites of different cells fused into a continuous reticulum or nerve net
- Neuron doctrine :: nerve cells are separate units connected at specific junctions (called synapses)

*** Over Physiology/Function
- Reticular theory :: flow of signals was purely electrical
     current flow continuous between cells
     nervous system is viewed as a functional syncitium

- Neuron doctrine :: electrical transmission not possible
     current flows out into the extracellular space
     chemical signal (neurotransmitter) is released by cell sending signal and received by another cell

** Synapses
*** Electrical synapse
- Ion channels connect cytoplasm of pre- and postsynaptic cell
- Some current flows through low-resistance, high-conductance channels that bridge cells, depolarising them
- If depolarisation > threshold, then AP occurs in postsynaptic cell
- Gap junction :: extracellular space between cells that is very narrow
		  pair of hemichannels (connexons) in pre and postsynaptic cells
		  connexon = 6 connexin protein subunits

**** Furshpan and Potter (1957)
- Observed the presence of electrical synapse by probing pre and postsynaptic elements of a crayfish
- Observed an action potential at the presynaptic element
- Observed electrical post synaptic potential at the postsynaptic element

**** Functional Significance
- Speed - some behaviours are instantaneous
- Developmental signaling - neighbouring cells can pass chemical and electrical signals through gap junction that coordinates growth/development
- Circuitry control - example: retina, during starlight, gap junctions couple rods to cone pathways
- Synchronisation - example: inferior olive neuron provides inputs to cerebellum
  - Inputs are synchronous for precise timing of motor control for coordination

*** Chemical synapse
- Neurons are separated by synaptic cleft
- No current crosses high-resistance of postsynaptic membrane
- AP leads to release of chemical transmitter that diffuses across synaptic cleft (cells are not connected structurally)
- Transmitter interacts with receptors on postsynaptic cell, causing either depolarisation or hyperpolarisation
- Synaptic cleft is larger than extracellular space
- Presynaptic cell has active zone
- Postsynaptic cell has densification
- Synaptic vesicles contain neurotransmitter

**** Henry Dale
- Dale's Principle :: Believes that a neuron has only one transmitter (false)

***** Actuality
- Neuropeptide :: held in large, dense core vesicles (secretory granules)
- Small molecule neurotransmitter :: held in small synaptic vesicles

- Neuron has preference to release small molecule neurotransmitters during low-frequency stimulation
- Both vesicles release with high frequency stimulation

***** Neuron Classification
- Cholinergic :: neurons that use acetylcholine
- Noradrenergic :: neurons that norepinephrine

**** Neurotransmitters
- Many different molecules can act as neurotransmitters
- Action of specific chemical messenger is dependent on receptor properties, not on the messenger
- Each synaptic vesicle stores one quantum of NT, so NT is released in discrete packets

- Does not always use vesicle storage and release
  - ATP in taste budes released through hemichannels
  - NA, CO traverse lipid bilayer by diffusion

***** Criteria
- Molecule must be synthesised and stored in the presynaptic neuron
- Molecule must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal
- Molecule must mimic postsynaptic effect of presynaptic stimulation when experimentally applied

***** Types
****** Amino Acids
- Synthesis occurs in the axon terminal
- Stored in synaptic vesicles

******* Examples
- Glutamate
- gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
- Glycine

****** Amines
- Synthesis occurs in the axon terminal
- Stored in synaptic vesicles

******* Examples
- Norepinephrine
- Epinephrine
- Dopamine
- Seratonin
- Histamine

****** Peptides
- Large molecules of amino acids strung together by the ribosomes in the rough ER
- Large precursor peptide is cleaved in the golgi apparatus
- Active peptide NT is packaged in secretory granules for transport and release

***** Recovery and Degradation
- Reuptake :: NT re-enter synaptic axon terminal
- Diffusion :: NT moves away from synapse
- Enzymatic destruction inside terminal cytosol or syynaptic cleft (AChE cleaves ACh to inactive state - choline and acetic acid)
  - Nerve gases (sarin) can inhibit AChE, causing prolonged contractions/paralysis

**** Receptors
***** Major Functions
- Recognise and bind transmitter
- Activate effector proteins

***** Reversal Potential
- Ligand-gated receptors often conduct more than one ion
- Each ion has its own Nernst potential and its own conductance g_Na and g_K
  - AChR g_Na > g_K
- Channel vehaves as if it conducts one ion whose Nernst potential is equal to reversal potential
- When an ligand-gated channel is activated, it works hard to try to take membrane voltage to reversal potential

***** Direct Gating (Ligand-gated Ion Channels)
- Several protein subunits form both the transmitter binding site and ion channel
- Receptor = effector
- Ionotropic receptor
- Effect of channel opening depends on ion being conducted

****** Neurotransmitters
- ACh
- Amino acids (Glutamate, GABA, Glycine)

****** Examples
******* AMPA-type Glu receptor
- Channel permeable to both Na+ and K+
- V_m = -65 mV
- E_reversal = 0 mV
- Net Na+ and K+ current flow brings V_m towards E_reversal (O mV)
- Channel makes it more likely to fire action potential
- EPSP :: excitatory post synaptic potential

******* Nicotinic ACh receptor
- Channel permeable to both Na+ and K+

- E_Na = 55 mV
- If V_m near E_Na, then large driving force on K+ to flow out, but no drive on Na+

- E_K = -100 mV
- If V_m near E_K, then large driving force on Na+ to come in, but no drive on K+

- E_reversal = 0 mV
- No net current

******* GABA-A receptor
- Channel only conducts Cl-
- V_m = -60 mV
- E_Cl = -65 mV
- Cl- current flows into the cell towards E_Cl, keeping V_m down near -65 mV
- Channel makes it less likely to fire action potential
- IPSP :: inhibitory post-synaptic potential

***** Indirect Gating (G-Protein-Coupled Receptors)
- Receptor protein that binds transmitter is distinct from the ion channel
- Effects of transmitter binding receptor are coupled to an effector protein by a set of proteins called G-proteins
- Receptor != effector
- Metabotropic receptor

- Primary protein is either on ion channel or an enzyme
- If an ion channel, then GPCR causes ion channel to open
- If an enzyme, then GPCR causes synthesis of a second messenger
  - These types of receptors act too slowly to cause an AP
  - Normally influence the efficacy of direct gating (ionotropic receptors)
  - Neuromodulatory
  - NT that bind are often called neuromodulators

- Exerts effects via GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins)
- Direct action :: effector is ion channel, G-protein activation directly activates channel
- Indirect action :: effect is enzyme, G-protein activation activates enzyme which creates second messenger which activates channel
     - beta-NE receptor activates G_s, which activates adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP
     - alpha-NE receptor activates G_i, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase to decrease cAMP production

****** Indirect Action Paths
- NE -> GPCR -> alpha subunit -> adenylyl cyclase -> ATP to cAMP -> protein kinase
- NT -> GPCR -> alpha subunit -> phospholipase C (PLC) -> PIP_2 to DAG and IP_3 -> DAG stimulates protein kinase C, IP3 stimulates Ca++ release -> Ca++ regulates downstream enzymes

- Many downstream enzymes are protein kinases
- Protein kinases transfer phosphate from ATP in cytosol to proteins (phosphorylation)
- Phosphorylation of ion channels causes protein conformation change which detemines whether channel is open or closed
- Protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups (dephosphorylation)
- Some big ones:
  - Protein kinase A (PKA)
  - Protein kinase C (PKC)
  - Calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase - CaMK

****** Neurotransmitters
- ACh
- Amino acids (Glutamate, GABA, Glycine)
- Small molecule neurotransmitters
- Large peptides

****** G-Protein and Effectors
- alpha subunit + GDP = inactive trimer complex (alpha, beta, and gamma stay together)
- alpha subunit + GTP = active trimer subunits (alpha subunit and beta-gamma subunit)
- Subunits interact with ion channels or enzymes that activate second messenger systems
- Hydrolysis of GTP by the alpha-subunit reassembles the inactive trimer

**** General Model (Ca++ Example)
- Voltage-gated Ca++ channels in the nerve terminal
- Ca++ necessary for vesicle fusion

***** Steps
1. Transmitter is synthesised and stored in vesicles
2. Action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal
3. Depolarisation opens Ca++ channels and causes influx
4. Ca++ causes vesicles to fuse with membrane
5. Transmitter is released into synaptic cleft
6. Transmitter binds to postsynaptic receptors
7. Opening or closing of postsynaptic channels
8. Postsynaptic current fires (either excitatory or inhibitory)
9. Retreival of vesicular membrane from plasma membrane

***** Docking
- When vesicle is attached to membrane for fusion
- SNARE proteins :: bring two membranes close together

****** Proteins to Know
- Synaptobrevin - on synaptic vesicle membrane
- Syntaxin and SNAP-25 - on plasma membrane
- Synaptotagmin - on vesicle membrane, binds Ca++ and produces membrane fusion

***** Receptor Examples
****** Cholinergic Receptor
- Nicotinic ACh Receptor :: produces excitation at neuromuscular junction
     - Agonist: Nicotine
     - Antagonist: Curare

- Muscarinic ACh Receptor :: produces inhibition in heart
     - Agonist: Muscarine
     - Antagonist: Atropine

- Agonist :: Mimics action of a neurotransmitter
- Antagonist :: Blocks action of a neurotransmitter


******* Cholinergic Neuron Proteins
- Choline acytltransferase (ChAT) :: Enzyme manufactured in soma and transported to terminal
- Vesicular ACh transpoter :: Transports ACh into vesicle
- Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) :: Manufacted by cholinergic neuron and secreted into synaptic cleft
- Choline transporter :: Transports choline into the terminal

******* Myesthenia Gravis
- Autoimmune against AChR
- Effect: Weakness and fatigability of voluntary muscles
- Treatment: anticholinesterase

******* Patch Clamping AChR
- Clamp membrane potential at a number of different holding potentials
- Apply ACh to bath
- Measure currents through ACh receptor channel

- Clamping at higher voltage: outward current
- Clamping at lower voltage: inward current

- Can calculate conductance as g = I/V = -20 mV/ -2 pA = 28.5 
****** Glutamatergic Receptor (Ionotropic)
- Activated by glutamate
- Cause excitatory postsynaptic potential

- AMPA Receptor :: AMPA as agonist
		   Has Na+ and K+ flow
- NMDA Receptor :: NMDA as agonist
		   Has Na+, K+, and Ca++ flow
- Kainate Receptor :: Kainate as agonist

- Both NMDA and AMPA receptors coexist in the postsynaptic membrane

******* NMDA Receptor (In-Detail)
- Both a ligand and voltage-gated ion channel

- Ligand gate: glutamate must be bound
- Voltage gate: at resting V_m, channel is blocked by Mg++

- Mg++ block is removed by depolarisation -> + ion repelled by cell being relatively positive inside
- Channel opening is activity dependent: AMPA receptor channels mediate initial depolarisation
  - Why NMDA and AMPA receptors coexist

- Acts as a coincidence detector
- Opens only when both pre and post synaptic elements are active
  - Pre: glutamate release
  - Post: depolarisation from AMPA receptors
- Na+ and Ca++ enter the postsynaptic cell
- Increased intracellular Ca++ initiates a cascade of events:
  1. Activates enzymes
  2. Regulates opening of ion channels
  3. Affects gene expression
  4. Can lead to increased synaptic strength for memory/learning

****** GABAergic Receptor
- Both GABA_A receptor and glycine receptor gate a Cl- channel
- Inhibitory Cl- current leads to IPSP

Some Other Chemicals That Affect It:
- Ethanol
- Benzodiazepine
- Barbiturate
- Neurosteroid

- Asymmetric
- Round vesicles
- Excitatory

**** Symmetrical Membrane Differentiations
- Gray's Type II
- Symmetric
- Flattened vesicles
- Inhibitory

** Neuromuscular Junction
- Used to study directly gated synaptic transmission
- Muscle cells are large
- Synapse can be visualised with light microscope
- Anatomy is simple
- Motor Unit :: motor neuron + muscle cell it innervates

- Presynaptic motor neuron AP leads to an EPSP large enough to reach threshold for an AP
- Endplate potential ~50-60 mV

*** Steps
1. ACh binding to receptor channel molecule
2. Channel opens
3. Na+ inflow, K+ outflow

** Synaptic Integration
*** How do neurons generate signals?
- Presynaptic signals are integrated at the dendrites and soma
- AP initiation at initial segment and axon hillock
- Impulse conduction - saltatory conduction in myelinated axons where AP "jumps" from node to node
- Transmitter secretion when AP reaches axon terminal

**** Decay
- Subthreshold signals decay with distance
- V_$\lambda$ = 0.37(V_0)
- $\lambda$ = length constant (index of how far depolarisation can spread)
  - Depends on internal resistance (r_i) and membrane resistance (r_m)

- Synapse placement on dendritic tree assigns weights to different synapses
- Synapses closer to the axon hillock will have a greater weight

*** How do neurons communicate with one another with electrical and chemical synapses?
**** Synaptic Integration Details
- Synapses add together in two ways: spatial summation and temporal summation

***** Spatial Summation
- Several spatially distinct inputs fire simultaneously, causing sufficient depolarisation to reach threshold

****** Inhibition
- Inhibitory signal can fire and make it harder to reach threshold
- Presynaptic inhibition :: releases less quanta, specific - aimed at particular excitatory inputs
- Postsynaptic inhibition :: affects all inputs therefore not specific

- Shunting inhibition :: inhibitory synapse along travel path can drop a decaying signal down to basically zero

***** Temporal Summation
- Summation of sequential postsynaptic effects of an individual presynaptic input, leading to sufficient depolarisation to reach threshold

*** How do neurons operate in neuronal circuits?
- All nervous systems evolved to generate behaviour (usually in response to stimuli)
- Sensory input -> CNS -> Motor output
- Integration :: Relationship between inputs and outputs

- Example: Knee jerk reflex 

- Divergence :: Most cells send inputs to a large number of other neurons
		One input -> Many outputs
- Convergence :: Most cells receive inputs from more than one cell
		 Many inputs -> one output

** Central Synapse
- Single presynaptic neuron is unlikely to excite a postsynaptic cell sufficiently to reach threshold
- EPSPs are smaller (1-2 mV)
- IPSP are preventing AP firing
