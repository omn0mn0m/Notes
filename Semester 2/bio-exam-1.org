Lecture 1, Slide 42

* Overview of Evolution & Causes of Variation
- In embryological development, structures emerge where they did not before
- Possible explanation for how evolution arised

- Allometry :: difference in growth rates of different body parts - causes change in body proportionality

** Homeotic Genes
- Different areas in DNA sequence can result in different anatomical developments
- Homology group will transcribe for similar anatomical structures

** Environmental Effects and Phenotypic Plasticity
- Normally, phenotypes would be distributed over a wide range
- Selection for efficiency can cause phenotype variety to narrow

*** Regulation and Selection
- Different conditions lead to changes from a previously common trait
- Example: Sharp-beaked finch that eats mixed diet of seeds/insects evolving into cactus finch that probs cactus flowers/fruit

** Evolution
- Evolution :: change in a population over time
- Observed in both living populations and in fossil records
- Evolutionary Theory :: current understanding of the mechanisms which drive evolution
- Sources of variation (mutation. recombination) -> physiological/development -> variation

*** Agents of Change
- Selection
- Drift
- Mutation
- Migration
- Non-Random Mating

*** Darwin's Contributions to Explaining Evolution
**** Species change over time
- Proposed by others, but previously proposed mechanisms weakended general support for the idea

**** Divergent species share a common ancestor and have become divergent gradually over a long time period
- Inspired by visit to Galapagos Islands in 1835
- Observed variations between species of finch that arose due to different environmental niches
- Differences in beak shape, food source, food obtaining
- Common ancestor from South America arrived at the islands
- Vertabrate forelimbs arose from a common ancestor that all extant vertebrates share

**** Differences can be explained through natural selection
- Surviving members of a species will pass down their phenotypes to future generations
- Surviving members possess a phenotype that is better fit for survivability
- Example: Green beetles are easier to see, so they die. Brown beetles are left, and create more brown beetles.

*** Mendel and Genetics
- Darwin was studying evolution while Mendel was studying genetics
- Information never got to Darwin of Mendel's work
- Mendellian genetics did not fit exactly with Darwin's theory that evolution is made of gradual changes
- Genetic variations contributes to phenotypic variations (seen by observing selective breeding)

**** Genetics Terminology
- Phenotype :: visible or measurable heritable trait
	       dominant and recessive traits
- Gene :: hereditary unit consisting of a DNA sequence that occupies a specific location on a chromosome (locus)
	  order of DNA determines order of monomers in a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule which a cell/virus may synthesise
- Allele :: one version of a gne (particular DNA sequence)
	    genes can have 2 or more alleles which can affect gene function and therefore affect phenotype
- Genotype :: all of the specific gene alleles which contribute to a phenotype
- Gene Pool :: sum of all of the alleles of a gene in a population
	       Example: 30 individuals = 60 alleles 
	       Allele frequency = # of alleles in pool / total alleles in pool
- Diploid :: has 2 alleles

* Modes of Selection
- Selection acts upon mutations already present in a population
- Random mutation is a source of genetic varaiation in a population

- Random mutation occurs prior to exposure to antibiotic = original colonies and stamped colonies will have matching survivability

* Genetic Drift


* Gene Flow & Migration


* Applications: Phage Display, Directed Evolution


* Molecular Evolution, Variation, & Society


* Traits & Understanding Phylogenetic Trees


* Classification & Mechanism of Speciation


* Major Events & Patterns on Earth


* Characteristics & Definition of Life


* Microbial Life & Its Origins


* Macrobial Life & the 3 Domains
